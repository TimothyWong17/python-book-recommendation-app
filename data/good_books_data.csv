1944,Jay Winik,/books/1944,"Jay Winik brings to life in âgrippingâ detail (The New York Times Book Review) the year 1944, which determined the outcome of World War II and put more pressure than any other on an ailing yet determined President Roosevelt.1944 was a year that could have stymied the Allies and cemented Hitlerâs waning power. Instead, it saved those democraciesâbut with a fateful cost. Now, in a âcomplex history rendered with great color and sympathyâ (Kirkus Reviews, starred review), Jay Winik captures the epic images and extraordinary history âwith cinematic forceâ (Time).1944 witnessed a series of titanic events: FDR at the pinnacle of his wartime leadership as well as his reelection, the unprecedented D-Day invasion, the liberation of Paris, and the tumultuous conferences that finally shaped the coming peace. But millions of lives were at stake as President Roosevelt learned about Hitlerâs Final Solution. Just as the Allies were landing in Normandy, the Nazis were accelerating the killing of millions of European Jews. Winik shows how escalating pressures fell on an infirm Roosevelt, who faced a momentous decision. Was winning the war the best way to rescue the Jews? Or would it get in the way of defeating Hitler? In a year when even the most audacious undertakings were within the worldâs reach, one challengeâsaving Europeâs Jewsâseemed to remain beyond Rooseveltâs grasp.âCompellingâ¦.This dramatic account highlights what too often has been glossed overâthat as nobly as the Greatest Generation fought under FDRâs command, America could well have done more to thwart Nazi aggressionâ (The Boston Globe). Destined to take its place as one of the great works of World War II, 1944 is the first book to retell these events with moral clarity and a moving appreciation of the extraordinary actions of many extraordinary leaders.","['non-fiction', 'history']",1,2023-12-22 00:00:00
1984,George Orwell,/books/1984,"Written more than 70 years ago, 1984 was George Orwellâs chilling prophecy about the future. And while 1984 has come and gone, his dystopian vision of a government that will do anything to control the narrative is timelier than ever...âThe Party told you to reject the evidence of your eyes and ears. It was their final, most essential command.âWinston Smith toes the Party line, rewriting history to satisfy the demands of the Ministry of Truth. With each lie he writes, Winston grows to hate the Party that seeks power for its own sake and persecutes those who dare to commit thoughtcrimes. But as he starts to think for himself, Winston canât escape the fact that Big Brother is always watching...A startling and haunting novel, 1984 creates an imaginary world that is completely convincing from start to finish. No one can deny the novelâs hold on the imaginations of whole generations, or the power of its admonitionsâa power that seems to grow, not lessen, with the passage of time.","['fiction', 'economics & politics']",18,2023-12-22 00:00:00

Wade takes readers inside his intriguing life and work in this magnificent 4-color book, which includes more than 100 never-before-seen images from Bob Metelus, who has been documenting Wade's career for more than a decade.Wade's difficult upbringing on Chicago's South Side, his college career at Marquette, where he went from unheralded recruit to one of college basketball's greatest stars, and his extraordinary years with the Miami Heat, with whom he won three NBA championships and was named an All-Star 13 times, are all depicted in three dimensions. The book focuses on Wade's core values, which have guided him throughout his career: being a great teammate and leader. While skill may make you a celebrity, Wade explains that being a champion requires sacrifice: putting the team's aims ahead of your own ego. Wade has lived this philosophy throughout his career, from his days with Shaq (with whom he won his first title), through the ""Big 3"" with LeBron and Bosh, to his final season as a player, when he coached the Heat's bright but youthful lineup. These same ideals have impacted his personal life as well, allowing him to be a supportive husband and partner to Gabrielle Union, as well as an exceptional role model for his children.3 Dimensional is a fascinating look into the mind and heart of one of basketball's most charismatic players. It is the definitive inside look at the life and career of one of the sport's biggest players, and it coincides with a documentary chronicling Wade's last NBA season.","['non-fiction', 'health & fitness', 'biographies & memoirs']",1,2022-02-08 00:00:00
30 Rooms to Hide In,Luke Longstreet Sullivan,/books/30-rooms-to-hide-in,"The remarkable tale of six brothers growing up in the â50s and â60s as their fatherâa highly respected Mayo Clinic surgeonâslowly goes insane.Author Luke Longstreet Sullivan has a simple way of describing his new memoir: âItâs like The Shining . . . only funnier.â Thirty Rooms to HideIn tells the astonishing story of Sullivanâs father and his descent from one of the worldâs top orthopedic surgeons at the Mayo Clinic to a man who is increasingly abusive, alcoholic, and insane, ultimately dying alone on the floor of a Georgia motel room. For his wife and six sons, the years prior to his death were characterized by turmoil, anger, and family dysfunction; but somehow they were also a time of real happiness for Sullivan and his brothers, full of dark humor and much laughter.Through the 1950s and 1960s, the six brothers had a wildly fun and thoroughly dysfunctional childhood living in a forbidding thirty-room mansion, known as the Millstone, on the outskirts of Rochester, Minnesota. The many rooms of the immense home, as well as their motherâs loving protection, allowed the Sullivan brothers to grow up as normal, mischievous boys. Against a backdrop of the timesâthe Cold War, the Cuban Missile Crisis, fallout shelters, JFKâs assassination, and the Beatlesâthe cracks in their home life and their fatherâs psyche continue to widen. When their mother decides to leave the Millstone and move the family across town, the Sullivan boys are able to find solace in each other and in rock ânâ roll.As Thirty Rooms to Hide In follows the story of the Sullivan familyâat times grim, at others poignantâa wonderful, dark humor lifts the narrative. Tragic, funny, and powerfully evocative of the 1950s and 1960s, Thirty Rooms to Hide In is a tale of public success and private dysfunction, personal and familial resilience, and the strange power of humor to give refuge when it is needed most, even if it canât always provide the answers.","['non-fiction', 'biographies & memoirs']",1,2020-05-13 00:00:00

A Canticle for Leibowitz,Walter M. Miller Jr.,/books/a-canticle-for-leibowitz,"Walter M. Miller's acclaimed SF classic A Canticle for Leibowitz opens with the accidental excavation of a holy artifact: a creased, brittle memo scrawled by the hand of the blessed Saint Leibowitz, that reads: ""Pound pastrami, can kraut, six bagels--bring home for Emma."" To the Brothers of Saint Leibowitz, this sacred shopping list penned by an obscure, 20th-century engineer is a symbol of hope from the distant past, from before the Simplification, the fiery atomic holocaust that plunged the earth into darkness and ignorance. As 1984 cautioned against Stalinism, so 1959's A Canticle for Leibowitz warns of the threat and implications of nuclear annihilation. Following a cloister of monks in their Utah abbey over some six or seven hundred years, the funny but bleak Canticle tackles the sociological and religious implications of the cyclical rise and fall of civilization, questioning whether humanity can hope for more than repeating its own history. Divided into three sections--Fiat Homo (Let There Be Man), Fiat Lux (Let There Be Light), and Fiat Voluntas Tua (Thy Will Be Done)--Canticle is steeped in Catholicism and Latin, exploring the fascinating, seemingly capricious process of how and why a person is canonized. --Paul Hughes Winner of the 1961 Hugo Award for Best Novel and widely considered one of the most accomplished, powerful, and enduring classics of modern speculative fiction, Walter M.

And the spoils of victory may just go to the men and women possessed of the coldest steel . . . and the coldest hearts.

With the death of the monstrous King Joffrey, Cersei is ruling as regent in Kingâs Landing. Robb Starkâs demise has broken the back of the Northern rebels, and his siblings are scattered throughout the kingdom like seeds on barren soil. Few legitimate claims to the once desperately sought Iron Throne still existâor they are held in hands too weak or too distant to wield them effectively. The war, which raged out of control for so long, has burned itself out.But as in the aftermath of any climactic struggle, it is not long before the survivors, outlaws, renegades, and carrion eaters start to gather, picking over the bones of the dead and fighting for the spoils of the soon-to-be dead. Now in the Seven Kingdoms, as the human crows assemble over a banquet of ashes, daring new plots and dangerous new alliances are formed, while surprising facesâsome familiar, others only just appearingâare seen emerging from an ominous twilight of past struggles and chaos to take up the challenges ahead.It is a time when the wise and the ambitious, the deceitful and the strong will acquire the skills, the power, and the magic to survive the stark and terrible times that lie before them. It is a time for nobles and commoners, soldiers and sorcerers, assassins and sages to come together and stake their fortunes . . . and their lives. For at a feast for crows, many are the guestsâbut only a few are the survivors.",['fiction'],2,2023-12-22 00:00:00

A Giacometti Portrait,James Lord,/books/a-giacometti-portrait,"Alberto Giacometti was born in Switzerland and became a student of the arts early in life. He travelled to Paris in his early twenties and became a painter, sculptor and printmaker. Throughout his life and work he focused on three core themes, standing women, busts and a man in movement. He experimented with surrealism and cubism and kept a riotously colourful list of acquaintances and contemporaries including Picasso and MirÃ³.Giacometti was in many ways the perfect subject for a study on the creative process. He was bohemian but still driven. James Lord, an author and his biographer, agreed to sit for a portrait by the artist and this book is the result of his recording of those days. He did not merely experience the day to day activity in the studio or Giacometti's many idiosyncrasies, Lord recorded the artist's emotional state and the tribulations and distractions that occurred over the 18 days of sitting. Lord shows us a man who seems irritable but warm, engaging but absorbed in his work.'Giacometti's Portrait' details Alberto's fixation on his younger brother as a model for his work, his messy surroundings and the cigarette ash dropping to the floor as he became distracted. Creatives of all kinds will appreciate the reliance of Giacometti on the ritual and instinctive in striving to create a meaningful work of art. The two eggs the artist needed to eat, the two glasses of beaujolais and the two cups of coffee that were required are familiar to all of us from the student writing an essay to the artist creating a masterpiece. The earthly fortifications that surround the creation of art which is supposed to transcend them remain fascinating.","['non-fiction', 'arts & entertainment', 'biographies & memoirs']",1,2023-12-22 00:00:00

A Great Leap Forward,Alexander J. Field,/books/a-great-leap-forward,"This bold re-examination of the history of U.S. economic growth is built around a novel claim, that productive capacity grew dramatically across the Depression years (1929-1941) and that this advance provided the foundation for the economic and military success of the United States during the Second World War as well as for the golden age (1948-1973) that followed. Alexander J. Field takes a fresh look at growth data and concludes that, behind a backdrop of double-digit unemployment, the 1930s actually experienced very high rates of technological and organizational innovation, fueled by the maturing of a privately funded research and development system and the government-funded build-out of the country's surface road infrastructure.

If we watch ourselves as we go about our daily business and later reflect on what we saw, we can better identify the sources of distress and eventually avoid that pain in our life. By doing this, the Stoics thought, we can hope to attain a truly joyful life.","['spirituality & religion', 'philosophy', 'self improvement', 'non-fiction', 'psychology']",8,2023-12-22 00:00:00

In addition to reviewing recent interpretations of the individual traditions, he explores the interactions of the three religions and shows their continuing mutual influence to be subtle but unmistakable.As in his previous work, Eliade pays particular attention to heresies, folk beliefs, and cults of secret wisdom, such as alchemy and sorcery, and continues the discussion, begun in earlier volumes, of pre-Christian shamanistic practices in northern Europe and the syncretistic tradition of Tibetan Buddhism. These subcultures, he maintains, are as important as the better-known orthodoxies to a full understanding of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam.","['non-fiction', 'spirituality & religion', 'economics & politics', 'history']",1,2023-12-22 00:00:00

A History of World Agriculture,Marcel Mazoyer & Laurence Roudart,/books/a-history-of-world-agriculture,"Only once we understand the long history of human efforts to draw sustenance from the land can we grasp the nature of the crisis that faces humankind today, as hundreds of millions of people are faced with famine or flight from the land. From Neolithic times through the earliest civilizations of the ancient Near East, in savannahs, river valleys and the terraces created by the Incas in the Andean mountains, an increasing range of agricultural techniques have developed in response to very different conditions. These developments are recounted in this book, with detailed attention to the ways in which plants, animals, soil, climate, and society have interacted.Mazoyer and Roudartâs A History of World Agriculture is a path-breaking and panoramic work, beginning with the emergence of agriculture after thousands of years in which human societies had depended on hunting and gathering, showing how agricultural techniques developed in the different regions of the world, and how this extraordinary wealth of knowledge, tradition and natural variety is endangered today by global capitialism, as it forces the unequal agrarian heritages of the world to conform to the norms of profit.During the twentieth century, mechanization, motorization and specialization have brought to a halt the pattern of cultural and environmental responses that characterized the global history of agriculture until then. Today a small number of corporations have the capacity to impose the farming methods on the planet that they find most profitable. Mazoyer and Roudart propose an alternative global strategy that can safegaurd the economies of the poor countries, reinvigorate the global economy, and create a livable future for mankind.","['non-fiction', 'science & nature', 'history']",1,2023-12-22 00:00:00

A Hunger Artist,Franz Kafka,/books/a-hunger-artist,"A Hunger Artist is a short story by Franz Kafka. The protagonist, a hunger artist who experiences the decline in appreciation of his craft, is an archetypical creation of Kafka: an individual marginalized and victimized by society at large. The title of the story has been translated also to ""A Fasting Artist"" and ""A Starvation Artist"". A Hunger Artist was first published in the periodical Die neue Rundschau in 1922 and was subsequently included as the title piece in the short story collection. ""A Hunger Artist"" explores the familiar Kafka themes of death, art, isolation, asceticism, spiritual poverty, futility, personal failure and the corruption of human relationships. There is a sharp division among critical interpretations of ""A Hunger Artist"".Most commentators concur that the story is an allegory, but they disagree as to what is represented. Some critics[who?], pointing to the hunger artist's asceticism, regard him as a saintly or even Christ-like figure. In support of this view they emphasize the unworldliness of the protagonist, the priest-like quality of the watchers, and the traditional religious significance of the forty-day period. Other critics[who?] insist that A Hunger Artist is an allegory of the misunderstood artist, whose vision of transcendence and artistic excellence is rejected or ignored by the public. This interpretation is sometimes joined with a reading of the story as autobiographical. According to this view, this story, written near the end of Kafka's life, links the hunger artist with the author as an alienated artist who is dying.",['fiction'],2,2023-12-22 00:00:00

A Liberated Mind,Steven C. Hayes,/books/a-liberated-mind,"Life is not a problem to be solved. ACT shows how we can live full and meaningful lives by embracing our vulnerability and turning toward what hurts.In this landmark book, the originator and pioneering researcher into Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) lays out the psychological flexibility skills that make it one of the most powerful approaches research has yet to offer. These skills have been shown to help even where other approaches have failed. Science shows that they are useful in virtually every area--mental health (anxiety, depression, substance abuse, eating disorders, PTSD); physical health (chronic pain, dealing with diabetes, facing cancer); social processes (relationship issues, prejudice, stigma, domestic violence); and performance (sports, business, diet, exercise).How does psychological flexibility help? We struggle because the problem-solving mind tells us to run from what causes us fear and hurt. But we hurt where we care. If we run from a sense of vulnerability, we must also run from what we care about. By learning how to liberate ourselves, we can live with meaning and purpose, along with our pain when there is pain.Although that is a simple idea, it resists our instincts and programming. The flexibility skills counter those ingrained tendencies. They include noticing our thoughts with curiosity, opening to our emotions, attending to what is in the present, learning the art of perspective taking, discovering our deepest values, and building habits based around what we deeply want.Beginning with the epiphany Steven Hayes had during a panic attack, this book is a powerful narrative of scientific discovery filled with moving stories as well as advice for how we can put flexibility skills to work immediately. Hayes shows how allowing ourselves to feel fully and think freely moves us toward commitment to what truly matters to us. Finally, we can live lives that reflect the qualities we choose.","['non-fiction', 'psychology', 'self improvement']",1,2023-12-22 00:00:00
A Life Decoded,J. Craig Venter,/books/a-life-decoded,"The triumphant true story of the man who achieved one of the greatest feats of our eraâthe mapping of the human genome.Growing up in California, Craig Venter didnât appear to have much of a future. An unremarkable student, he nearly flunked out of high school. After being drafted into the army, he enlisted in the navy and went to Vietnam, where the life and death struggles he encountered as a medic piqued his interest in science and medicine. After pursuing his advanced degrees, Venter quickly established himself as a brilliant and outspoken scientist. In 1984 he joined the National Institutes of Health, where he introduced novel techniques for rapid gene discovery, and left in 1991 to form his own nonprofit genomics research center, where he sequenced the first genome in history in 1995. In 1998 he announced that he would successfully sequence the human genome years earlier, and for far less money, than the government-sponsored Human Genome Project wouldâ a prediction he kept in 2001âA Life Decoded is the triumphant story of one of the most fascinating and controversial figures in science today. In his riveting and inspiring account Venter tells of the unparalleled drama of the quest for the human genome, a tale that involves as much politics (personal and political) as science. He also reveals how he went on to be the first to read and interpret his own genome and what it will mean for all of us to do the same. He describes his recent sailing expedition to sequence microbial life in the ocean, as well as his groundbreaking attempt to create synthetic life. Here is one of the key scientific chronicles of our lifetime, as told by the man who beat the odds to make it happen.","['non-fiction', 'science & nature', 'biographies & memoirs']",1,2023-12-22 00:00:00

Population growth continues to increase, especially in the developing regions of the world. Controversy rages as to the use of fossil fuels versus the development of alternative forms of energy. Disagreement continues about climate change. Opposing currents of opinion collide as to how much we should help other areas in the world and how much to help ourselves. Basic values are in conflict.More than 40 years ago, Jonas Salk understood that we are at a unique moment in the history of the human species. After centuries of increase, population growth has begun to slow and is trending toward equilibrium. This change is accompanied by an equally significant change in human valuesâa shift from those based on unlimited availability of resources, unremitting growth, excess, independence, competition and short-term thinking to those based on limits, equilibrium, balance, interdependence, cooperation and long-term thinking. This momentous transition is the source of far-reaching tension and conflict.The way through this difficult era is to understand its basis and to focus on new values that will be of the greatest benefit to humankind. There is an urgency, however, and failure to adapt will result in disaster both for humanity and for the planet as a whole.âA New Reality delivers a message of both caution and hope. Readers across the social and political spectrum will find it a reasoned and balanced counterpoint to current social and political trends. Its elegant design and long-range perspective will appeal to general readers, policy makers, millennials, baby boomers, teachers, and students, filling a need in the marketplace for a work of positivity and wisdom in otherwise bleak times.","['non-fiction', 'science & nature', 'economics & politics', 'philosophy']",1,2023-12-22 00:00:00

A Pattern Language,Christopher Alexander et al.,/books/a-pattern-language,"At the core of A Pattern Language is the philosophy that in designing their environments people always rely on certain âlanguages,â which, like the languages we speak, allow them to articulate and communicate an infinite variety of designs within a formal system which gives them coherence.This book provides a language of this kind. It will enable making a design for almost any kind of building, or any part of the built environment. âPatterns,â the units of this language, are answers to design problems: how high should a window sill be?; how many stories should a building have?; how much space in a neighborhood should be devoted to grass and trees?More than 250 of the patterns in this language are outlined, each consisting of a problem statement, a discussion of the problem with an illustration, and a solution. As the authors say in their introduction, many of the patterns are archetypal, so deeply rooted in the nature of things that it seems likely that they will be a part of human nature and human action as much in five hundred years as they are today.âA Pattern Language is related to Alexanderâs other works in the Center for Environmental Structure series: The Timeless Way of Building (introductory volume) and The Oregon Experiment.","['non-fiction', 'design', 'arts & entertainment']",6,2023-12-22 00:00:00
A Peace to End All Peace,David Fromkin,/books/a-peace-to-end-all-peace,"Published with a new afterword from the authorâthe classic, bestselling account of how the modern Middle East was createdThe Middle East has long been a region of rival religions, ideologies, nationalisms, and ambitions. All of these conflictsâincluding the hostilities between Arabs and Israelis, and the violent challenges posed by Iraq's competing sectsâare rooted in the region's political inheritance: the arrangements, unities, and divisions imposed by the Allies after the First World War.In A Peace to End All Peace, David Fromkin reveals how and why the Allies drew lines on an empty map that remade the geography and politics of the Middle East. Focusing on the formative years of 1914 to 1922, when all seemed possible, he delivers in this sweeping and magisterial book the definitive account of this defining time, showing how the choices narrowed and the Middle East began along a road that led to the conflicts and confusion that continue to this day.A new afterword from Fromkin, written for this edition of the book, includes his invaluable, updated assessment of this region of the world today, and on what this history has to teach us.","['non-fiction', 'economics & politics', 'history']",2,2023-12-22 00:00:00

A Philosophy of Walking,FrÃ©dÃ©ric Gros,/books/a-philosophy-of-walking,"Leading thinker FrÃ©dÃ©ric Gros records the many varied ways we walk from point A to point B â the pilgrimage, the promenade, the protest march, the nature ramble â and shows what they say about us in A Philosophy of Walking, a bestseller in France.Other intellectuals, according to Gros, considered walking as an important part of their practice as well. On his travels, he mulls about Thoreau's eager solitude in Walden Woods, as well as the reason Rimbaud walked furiously while Nerval rambled to heal his sorrow. He demonstrates how Rousseau walked to contemplate and how Nietzsche explored the hills to write. To avoid the necessity of contemplation, Kant marched through his hometown every day at exactly the same hour. A Philosophy of Walking is a brilliant and intellectual credo for placing one foot in front of the other that is both amusing and informative.","['non-fiction', 'philosophy']",1,2023-12-22 00:00:00

A Place for Us,Fatima Farheen Mirza,/books/a-place-for-us,"A Place for Us unfolds the lives of an Indian-American Muslim family, gathered together in their Californian hometown to celebrate the eldest daughter, Hadia's, wedding - a match of love rather than tradition. It is here, on this momentous day, that Amar, the youngest of the siblings, reunites with his family for the first time in three years. Rafiq and Layla must now contend with the choices and betrayals that lead to their son's estrangement - the reckoning of parents who strove to pass on their cultures and traditions to their children; and of children who in turn struggle to balance authenticity in themselves with loyalty to the home they came from.In a narrative that spans decades and sees family life through the eyes of each member, A Place For Us charts the crucial moments in the family's past, from the bonds that bring them together to the differences that pull them apart. And as siblings Hadia, Huda, and Amar attempt to carve out a life for themselves, they must reconcile their present culture with their parent's faith, to tread a path between the old world and the new, and learn how the smallest decisions can lead to the deepest of betrayals.A deeply affecting and resonant story, A Place for Us is truly a book for our times: a moving portrait of what it means to be an American family today, a novel of love, identity and belonging that eloquently examines what it means to be both American and Muslim -- and announces Fatima Farheen Mirza as a major new literary talent.",['fiction'],1,2020-10-24 00:00:00

Matthieu Ricard takes the arguments from his best-selling books Altruism and Happiness to their logical conclusion: that compassion for all beings, including our fellow animals, is a moral obligation and the direction toward which any enlightened society must aspire in this compelling appeal to reason and human kindness. He documents the horrifying miseries of the animals we feed, dress, and use for ""entertainment,"" and challenges every conventional rationale for their exploitation with scientific facts and moral inquiry. What emerges is a clear and compelling ethical obligation to treat all creatures with respect and compassion with whom we share this world.","['science & nature', 'non-fiction', 'health & fitness', 'philosophy', 'self improvement', 'spirituality & religion']",1,2023-12-22 00:00:00
A Prayer for the City,Buzz Bissinger,/books/a-prayer-for-the-city,"In 1990, Buzz Bissinger's Friday Night Lights became an acclaimed bestseller and national sensation, igniting immediate debate about the role of high school football in small-town Texas. Â Now, the Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist does for big cities what he did for small towns in this epic story of one remarkable politician's efforts to save a dying American City.Mayor Edward Rendell will do almost anything for Philadelphia. Â He will clean the bathrooms in City Hall, endure a joint appearance with Mickey Mouse, and personally lobby President Clinton to keep jobs in the city. Â He is that rare politician who is larger than life in his ambitions, compassion, and flaws--a man wise enough to see the comic absurdity of his job, yet crazy enough to think he can actually revive his declining city.To succeed, Rendell must negotiate a tough new contract with city workers who are threatening to strike and wreak havoc on the city. Â He must allay African-American leaders engaged in a zero-sum game of racial politics. Â He must combat the loss of tens of thousands of jobs that have brought the Workshop of the World to its knees.As Rendell and his brilliant chief of staff, David Cohen fight these political battles, four citizens of Philadelphia engage in their own personal struggles, each one connected to events at City Hall:Jim Mangan is a thirty-seven-year-old welder with a wife and six children. Â Unless the mayor can achieve a miracle, he and thousands of others will lose their jobs at the city's historic Naval Shipyard.Linda Morrison is a city-employed policy analyst who believes urban life can improve if the mayor embraces unprecedented change. Â But will Rendell have the courage? Â Will she be able to sustain her love for the city, or will the pressures of crime and taxes drive her away?Mike McGovern is a prosecutor whose anger at the urban violence of the city fuels his drive for justice. Â As he questions the personal cost of what he does, he faces one of his toughest trials, seeking life imprisonment for a teenager charged with murder.Fifi Mazzccua is an elderly woman from the inner city raising four great-grandchildren while faithfully visiting her son in prison and hoping she'll live to see the day when he is freed.At turns heart-wrenching and hilarious, A Prayer for the City dramatically illustrates high-pressure politics and the threat of economic decline facing so many cities.

A Preponderance of Power,Melvyn P. Leffler,/books/a-preponderance-of-power,"In the United States the Cold War shaped our political culture, our institutions, and our national priorities. Abroad, it influenced the destinies of people everywhere. It divided Europe, split Germany, and engulfed the Third World. It led to a feverish arms race and massive sales of military equipment to poor nations. For at least four decades it left the world in a chronic state of tension where a miscalculation could trigger nuclear holocaust.Documents, oral histories, and memoirs illuminating the goals, motives, and fears of contemporary U.S. officials were already widely circulated and studied during the Cold War, but in the 1970s a massive declassification of documents from the Army, Navy, Air Force, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the Department of Defense, and some intelligence agencies reinvigorated historical study of this war which became the definitive conflict of its time. While many historians used these records to explore specialized topics, this author marshals the considerable available evidence on behalf of an overall analysis of national security policy during the Truman years. To date, it is the most comprehensive history of that administration's progressive embroilment in the Cold War.","['history', 'economics & politics']",1,2020-10-24 00:00:00
A Promised Land,Barack Obama,/books/a-promised-land,"A riveting, deeply personal account of history in the making, from the president who inspired us to believe in the power of democracy.In the stirring, highly anticipated first volume of his presidential memoirs, Barack Obama tells the story of his improbable odyssey from young man searching for his identity to leader of the free world, describing in strikingly personal detail both his political education and the landmark moments of the first term of his historic presidencyâa time of dramatic transformation and turmoil.Obama takes readers on a compelling journey from his earliest political aspirations to the pivotal Iowa caucus victory that demonstrated the power of grassroots activism to the watershed night of November 4, 2008, when he was elected 44th president of the United States, becoming the first African American to hold the nationâs highest office.Reflecting on the presidency, he offers a unique and thoughtful exploration of both the awesome reach and the limits of presidential power, as well as singular insights into the dynamics of U.S. partisan politics and international diplomacy. Obama brings readers inside the Oval Office and the White House Situation Room, and to Moscow, Cairo, Beijing, and points beyond. We are privy to his thoughts as he assembles his cabinet, wrestles with a global financial crisis, takes the measure of Vladimir Putin, overcomes seemingly insurmountable odds to secure passage of the Affordable Care Act, clashes with generals about U.S. strategy in Afghanistan, tackles Wall Street reform, responds to the devastating Deepwater Horizon blowout, and authorizes Operation Neptuneâs Spear, which leads to the death of Osama bin Laden.A Promised Land is extraordinarily intimate and introspectiveâthe story of one manâs bet with history, the faith of a community organizer tested on the world stage. Obama is candid about the balancing act of running for office as a Black American, bearing the expectations of a generation buoyed by messages of âhope and change,â and meeting the moral challenges of high-stakes decision-making. He is frank about the forces that opposed him at home and abroad, open about how living in the White House affected his wife and daughters, and unafraid to reveal self-doubt and disappointment. Yet he never wavers from his belief that inside the great, ongoing American experiment, progress is always possible.This beautifully written and powerful book captures Barack Obamaâs conviction that democracy is not a gift from on high but something founded on empathy and common understanding and built together, day by day.","['non-fiction', 'biographies & memoirs']",2,2022-06-24 00:00:00

A Savage War of Peace,Alistair Horne,/books/a-savage-war-of-peace,"From 1954 through 1962, Algeria was embroiled in a civil war. Six French administrations were overthrown, the Fourth Republic was overthrown, De Gaulle was restored to power, and a civil war on French territory was on the verge of erupting. During the battle, almost a million Muslim Algerians perished, while tens of thousands of European immigrants were forced to flee. The conflict was defined above all by an unholy union of revolutionary violence and repressive torture. The fiercely fought war that resulted in Algerian independence has been almost half a century, and yet, as Alistair Horne argues in his new prologue to his now-classic book of history, its ramifications are being felt not only in Algeria and France, but across the world.Indeed, the Algerian War appears to be a full-dress rehearsal for the amorphous struggle that ravaged the Balkans in the 1990s and now ravages the Middle East, from Beirut to Baghdad, in which questions of religion, nationalism, imperialism, and terrorism take on a new and increasingly lethal intensity. The classic history of the Algerian War, A Savage War of Peace is a book that brings that horrible and convoluted conflict to life with insight, certainty, and unflagging pace. It is both required reading for our current tumultuous times and an enduring tribute to the historian's craft.","['non-fiction', 'history']",1,2022-02-07 00:00:00

A Short Guide to a Happy Life,Anna Quindlen,/books/a-short-guide-to-a-happy-life,"From the author of Blessings and Still Life with Bread Crumbs, Anna Quindlenâs classic reflection on a meaningful life is the perfect gift for graduation, or any occasion.ââLife is made of moments, small pieces of silver amidst long stretches of tedium. It would be wonderful if they came to us unsummoned, but particularly in lives as busy as the ones most of us lead now, that wonât happen. We have to teach ourselves now to live, really live . . . to love the journey, not the destination.ââIn this treasure of a book, Anna Quindlen, the bestselling novelist and columnist, reflects on what it takes to âget a lifeââto live deeply every day and from your own unique self, rather than merely to exist through your days. âKnowledge of our own mortality is the greatest gift God ever gives us,â Quindlen writes, âbecause unless you know the clock is ticking, it is so easy to waste our days, our lives.â Her mother died when Quindlen was nineteen: âIt was the dividing line between seeing the world in black and white, and in Technicolor. The lights came on for the darkest possible reason. . . . I learned something enduring, in a very short period of time, about life. And that was that it was glorious, and that you had no business taking it for granted.â But how to live from that perspective, to fully engage in our days? In A Short Guide to a Happy Life, Quindlen guides us with an understanding that comes from knowing how to see the view, the richness in living.","['non-fiction', 'self improvement', 'biographies & memoirs', 'philosophy']",2,2023-12-22 00:00:00

Taking as territory everything from the Big Bang to the rise of civilization, Bryson seeks to understand how we got from there being nothing at all to there being us. To that end, he has attached himself to a host of the worldâs most advanced (and often obsessed) archaeologists, anthropologists, and mathematicians, travelling to their offices, laboratories, and field camps. He has read (or tried to read) their books, pestered them with questions, apprenticed himself to their powerful minds.âA Short History of Nearly Everything is the record of this quest, and it is a sometimes profound, sometimes funny, and always supremely clear and entertaining adventure in the realms of human knowledge, as only Bill Bryson can render it.

Hume's Abstract of the Treatise, also included in the volume, outlines his 'chief argument' regarding our conception of, and belief in, cause and effect.

And finally, why is there something rather than nothing?âOne of the few prominent scientists today to have crossed the chasm between science and popular culture, Krauss describes the staggeringly beautiful experimental observations and mind-bending new theories that demonstrate not only can something arise from nothing, something will always arise from nothing. With a new preface about the significance of the discovery of the Higgs particle, A Universe from Nothing uses Kraussâs characteristic wry humor and wonderfully clear explanations to take us back to the beginning of the beginning, presenting the most recent evidence for how our universe evolvedâand the implications for how itâs going to end.Provocative, challenging, and delightfully readable, this is a game-changing look at the most basic underpinning of existence and a powerful antidote to outmoded philosophical, religious, and scientific thinking.","['non-fiction', 'science & nature', 'philosophy']",1,2023-12-22 00:00:00
"A Uterus Is a Feature, Not a Bug",Sarah Lacy,/books/a-uterus-is-a-feature-not-a-bug,"A rallying cry for working mothers everywhere that demolishes the ""distracted, emotional, weak"" stereotype and definitively shows that these professionals are more focused, decisive, and stronger than any other force.Working mothers arenât a liability. They are assets youâand every manager and executiveâwant in your company, in your investment portfolio, and in your corner.There is copious academic research showing the benefits of working mothers on families and the benefits to companies who give women longer and more flexible parental leave. There are even findings that demonstrate women with multiple children actually perform better at work than those with none or one.Yet despite this concrete proof that working mothers are a lucrative asset, they still face the ""Maternal Wall""âwidespread unconscious bias about their abilities, contributions, and commitment. Nearly eighty percent of women are less likely to be hired if they have childrenâand are half as likely to be promoted. Mothers earn an average $11,000 less in salary and are held to higher punctuality and performance standards. Forty percent of Silicon Valley women said they felt the need to speak less about their family to be taken more seriously. Many have been told that having a second child would cost them a promotion.Fortunately, this prejudice is slowly giving way to new attitudes, thanks to more women starting their own businesses, and companies like Netflix, Facebook, Apple, and Google implementing more parent-friendly policies. But the most important barrier to change isnât about men. Women must rethink the way they see themselves after giving birth. As entrepreneur Sarah Lacy makes clear in this cogent, persuasive analysis and clarion cry, the strongest, most lucrative, and most ambitious time of a womanâs career may easily be after she sees a plus sign on a pregnancy test.","['non-fiction', 'business & management', 'biographies & memoirs']",1,2020-10-24 00:00:00
A Vast Machine,Paul N.

Today, no collection of signals or observationsâeven from satellites, which can âseeâ the whole planet with a single instrumentâbecomes global in time and space without passing through a series of data models. Everything we know about the world's climate we know through models.

A Very Expensive Poison,Luke Harding,/books/a-very-expensive-poison,"A true story of murder and conspiracy that points directly to Vladimir Putin, by The Guardianâs former Moscow bureau chief.On November 1, 2006, journalist and Russian dissident Alexander Litvinenko was poisoned in London. He died twenty-two days later. The cause of death? Poloniumâa rare, lethal, and highly radioactive substance. Here Luke Harding unspools a real-life political assassination storyâcomplete with KGB, CIA, MI6, and Russian mobsters. He shows how Litvinenkoâs murder foreshadowed the killings of other Kremlin critics, from Washington, DC, to Moscow, and how these are tied to Russiaâs current misadventures in Ukraine and Syria. In doing so, he becomes a target himself and unearths a chain of corruption and death leading straight to Vladimir Putin. From his investigations of the downing of flight MH17 to the Panama Papers, Harding sheds a terrifying light on Russiaâs fracturing relationship with the West.","['non-fiction', 'economics & politics']",1,2023-12-22 00:00:00
A Vindication of the Rights of Men,Mary Wollstonecraft,/books/a-vindication-of-the-rights-of-men,"This volume brings together the major political writings of Mary Wollstonecraft in the order in which they appeared in the revolutionary 1790s. It traces her passionate and indignant response to the excitement of the early days of the French Revolution and then her uneasiness at its later bloody phase. It reveals her developing understanding of women's involvement in the political and social life of the nation and her growing awareness of the relationship between politics and economics and between political institutions and the individual. In personal terms, the works show her struggling with a belief in the perfectibility of human nature through rational education, a doctrine that became weaker under the onslaught of her own miserable experience and the revolutionary massacres.Janet Todd's introduction illuminates the progress of Wollstonecraft's thought, showing that a reading of all three works allows her to emerge as a more substantial political writer than a study of The Rights of Woman alone can reveal.","['non-fiction', 'philosophy', 'history', 'economics & politics']",1,2020-10-29 00:00:00

A Visit from the Goon Squad,Jennifer Egan,/books/a-visit-from-the-goon-squad,"Jennifer Eganâs spellbinding interlocking narratives circle the lives of Bennie Salazar, an aging former punk rocker and record executive, and Sasha, the passionate, troubled young woman he employs. Although Bennie and Sasha never discover each otherâs pasts, the reader does, in intimate detail, along with the secret lives of a host of other characters whose paths intersect with theirs, over many years, in locales as varied as New York, San Francisco, Naples, and Africa.We first meet Sasha in her mid-thirties, on her therapistâs couch in New York City, confronting her long-standing compulsion to steal. Later, we learn the genesis of her turmoil when we see her as the child of a violent marriage, then as a runaway living in Naples, then as a college student trying to avert the suicidal impulses of her best friend. We plunge into the hidden yearnings and disappointments of her uncle, an art historian stuck in a dead marriage, who travels to Naples to extract Sasha from the cityâs demimonde and experiences an epiphany of his own while staring at a sculpture of Orpheus and Eurydice in the Museo Nazionale. We meet Bennie Salazar at the melancholy nadir of his adult lifeâdivorced, struggling to connect with his nine-year-old son, listening to a washed-up band in the basement of a suburban houseâand then revisit him in 1979, at the height of his youth, shy and tender, reveling in San Franciscoâs punk scene as he discovers his ardor for rock and roll and his gift for spotting talent. We learn what became of his high school gangâwho thrived and who falteredâand we encounter Lou Kline, Bennieâs catastrophically careless mentor, along with the lovers and children left behind in the wake of Louâs far-flung sexual conquests and meteoric rise and fall.âA Visit from the Goon Squad is a book about the interplay of time and music, about survival, about the stirrings and transformations set inexorably in motion by even the most passing conjunction of our fates. In a breathtaking array of styles and tones ranging from tragedy to satire to PowerPoint, Egan captures the undertow of self-destruction that we all must either master or succumb to; the basic human hunger for redemption; and the universal tendency to reach for bothâand escape the merciless progress of timeâin the transporting realms of art and music.

A Widow for One Year,John Irving,/books/a-widow-for-one-year,"âOne night when she was four and sleeping in the bottom bunk of her bunk bed, Ruth Cole woke to the sound of lovemakingâit was coming from her parentsâ bedroom.âThis sentence opens John Irvingâs ninth novel, A Widow for One Year, a story of a family marked by tragedy. Ruth Cole is a complex, often self-contradictory characterâa âdifficultâ woman. By no means is she conventionally ânice,â but she will never be forgotten.Ruthâs story is told in three parts, each focusing on a critical time in her life.

She distrusts her judgment in men, for good reason.A Widow for One Year closes in the autumn of 1995, when Ruth Cole is a forty-one-year-old widow and mother. Sheâs about to fall in love for the first time.Richly comic, as well as deeply disturbing, A Widow for One Year is a multilayered love story of astonishing emotional force.

She is a mostly-happily married mother of three, an attentive daughter, an ambivalent dog-owner, a part-time editor, a loyal neighbor and a Zen commuter. She is not: a cook, a craftswoman, a decorator, an active PTA member, a natural caretaker or the breadwinner.

A World-Class Education,Vivien Stewart,/books/a-world-class-education,"In the 20th century, the United States was the world leader in educationâthe first country to achieve universal secondary education and the first to expand higher education beyond the elite class. Now other countries are catching up and leaping aheadâin high school graduation rates, in the quality and equity of their Kâ12 education systems, and in the proportion of students graduating from college. It is not that American education has gotten worse so much that education in other parts of the world has gotten so much better, so fast.Designed to promote conversation about how to educate students for a rapidly changing and increasingly borderless and innovation-based world, this comprehensive and illuminating book from international education expert Vivien Stewart is not about casting blame; it is about understanding what the best school systems in the world are doing right for the purpose of identifying what U.S. schoolsâat the national, state, and local levelâmight do differently and better. Here, youâll consider:How the U.S. education system fares against emerging international standards of excellence.The policies, practices, and priorities of the worldâs best-performing systems, along with specific ideas for adapting these approaches for U.S. schools.The common factors characteristic of high-performing and rapidly improving systems.New models of 21st century teaching and leadership and ways to modernize curriculum, instruction, and assessment.How technology and international exchange can help the United States close performance gaps and reach new levels of excellence and equity.Learning goes both ways, Stewart writes. Other countries have learned a great deal from the United States, and now it is time for American educators to open their eyes to other nationsâ globally-minded and future-focused practices, leverage existing assets, and create a truly world-class education system for this generation of students and generations to come.","['non-fiction', 'economics & politics', 'history']",1,2023-12-22 00:00:00

Absence of Mind,Marilynne Robinson,/books/absence-of-mind,"In this ambitious book, acclaimed writer Marilynne Robinson applies her astute intellect to some of the most vexing topics in the history of human thoughtâscience, religion, and consciousness. Crafted with the same care and insight as her award-winning novels, Absence of Mind challenges postmodern atheists who crusade against religion under the banner of science. In Robinsonâs view, scientific reasoning does not denote a sense of logical infallibility, as thinkers like Richard Dawkins might suggest. Instead, in its purest form, science represents a search for answers. It engages the problem of knowledge, an aspect of the mystery of consciousness, rather than providing a simple and final model of reality.By defending the importance of individual reflection, Robinson celebrates the power and variety of human consciousness in the tradition of William James. She explores the nature of subjectivity and considers the culture in which Sigmund Freud was situated and its influence on his model of self and civilization. Through keen interpretations of language, emotion, science, and poetry, Absence of Mind restores human consciousness to its central place in the religion-science debate.","['non-fiction', 'philosophy', 'science & nature']",1,2020-09-27 00:00:00

And of Buddha: ""Down through the centuries, through the centuries, through many lives, I have loved him. He is tremendously beautiful, extraordinarily beautiful, superb. But he is not on the earth, he does not walk on the earth. He is one-sided."" And he continues, "" I speak on Lao Tzu totally differently. I am not related to him because even to be related a distance is needed. When I speak on Lao Tzu I speak as if I am speaking on my own self. With him my being is totally on...it is as if I am looking in a mirror: my own face is reflected.When I speak on Lao Tzu, I am absolutely with him. Even to say ""absolutely with him"" is not true - I am him, he is me."" This book goes straight to the heart of the matter. Osho uses the Tao Te Ching texts as Lao Tze intended: to ignite the flame of individual awareness and insight. From the seven verses Osho selected to comment on, he moves deeply into his own understanding and burns through every idea we may hold about ourselves until we can see with the same crystal clear light as Lao Tzu.","['non-fiction', 'spirituality & religion', 'philosophy']",1,2020-10-24 00:00:00

According to their analysis of more than 2,300 undergraduates at twenty-four institutions, 45 percent of these students demonstrate no significant improvement in a range of skillsâincluding critical thinking, complex reasoning, and writingâduring their first two years of college. As troubling as their findings are, Arum and Roksa argue that for many faculty and administrators they will come as no surpriseâinstead, they are the expected result of a student body distracted by socializing or working and an institutional culture that puts undergraduate learning close to the bottom of the priority list.Academically Adrift holds sobering lessons for students, faculty, administrators, policy makers, and parentsâall of whom are implicated in promoting or at least ignoring contemporary campus culture. Higher education faces crises on a number of fronts, but Arum and Roksaâs report that colleges are failing at their most basic mission will demand the attention of us all.","['non-fiction', 'economics & politics']",1,2023-12-22 00:00:00

Accidental Presidents,Jared Cohen,/books/accidental-presidents,"The strength and prestige of the American presidency has waxed and waned since George Washington. Accidental Presidents looks at eight men who came to the office without being elected to it. It demonstrates how the character of the man in that powerful seat affects the nation and world.Eight men have succeeded to the presidency when the incumbent died in office. In one way or another they vastly changed our history. Only Theodore Roosevelt would have been elected in his own right. Only TR, Truman, Coolidge, and LBJ were re-elected.John Tyler succeeded William Henry Harrison who died 30 days into his term. He was kicked out of his party and became the first president threatened with impeachment. Millard Fillmore succeeded esteemed General Zachary Taylor. He immediately sacked the entire cabinet and delayed an inevitable Civil War by standing with Henry Clayâs compromise of 1850. Andrew Johnson, who succeeded our greatest president, sided with remnants of the Confederacy in Reconstruction. Chester Arthur, the embodiment of the spoils system, was so reviled as James Garfieldâs successor that he had to defend himself against plotting Garfieldâs assassination; but he reformed the civil service. Theodore Roosevelt broke up the trusts. Calvin Coolidge silently cooled down the Harding scandals and preserved the White House for the Republican Herbert Hoover and the Great Depression. Truman surprised everybody when he succeeded the great FDR and proved an able and accomplished president. Lyndon B. Johnson was named to deliver Texas electorally. He led the nation forward on Civil Rights but failed on Vietnam.âAccidental Presidents adds immeasurably to our understanding of the power and limits of the American presidency in critical times.","['non-fiction', 'history', 'economics & politics', 'biographies & memoirs']",2,2020-10-23 00:00:00

Nobel Laureate Gary Becker disagrees, and in this lively new collection he confronts the problem of preferences and values: how they are formed and how they affect our behavior. He argues that past experiences and social influences form two basic capital stocks: personal and social. He then applies these concepts to assessing the effects of advertising, the power of peer pressure, the nature of addiction, and the function of habits. This framework promises to illuminate many other realms of social life previously considered off-limits by economists.","['non-fiction', 'economics & politics', 'money & investing']",1,2023-12-22 00:00:00

Acid Test,Tom Shroder,/books/acid-test,"Itâs no secret that psychedelic drugs have the ability to cast light on the miraculous reality hidden within our psyche. Almost immediately after the discovery of LSD less than a hundred years ago, psychedelics began to play a crucial role in the quest to understand the link between mind and matter. With an uncanny ability to reveal the mindâs remote frontiers and the unmapped areas of human consciousness, LSD and MDMA (better known as Ecstasy) have proven extraordinarily effective in treating anxiety disorders such as PTSDâyet the drugs remain illegal for millions of people who might benefit from them.Anchoring Tom Shroderâs Acid Test are the stories of Rick Doblin, the founder and executive director of the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS), who has been fighting government prohibition of psychedelics for more than thirty years; Michael Mithoefer, a former emergency room physician, now a psychiatrist at the forefront of psychedelic therapy research; and his patient Nicholas Blackston, a former Marine who has suffered unfathomable mental anguish from the effects of brutal combat experiences in Iraq. All three men are passionate, relatable people; each flawed, each resilient, and each eccentric, yet very familiar and very human.Acid Test covers the first heady years of experimentation in the fifties and sixties, through the backlash of the seventies and eighties, when the drug subculture exploded and uncontrolled use of street psychedelics led to a PR nightmare that created the drug stereotypes of the present day. Meticulously researched and astoundingly informative, this is at once a personal story of intertwining lives against an epic backdrop, and a compelling argument for the unprecedented healing properties of drugs that have for decades been characterized as dangerous, illicit substances.","['non-fiction', 'science & nature']",2,2023-12-22 00:00:00

It was a sacrifice he was willing to make to give it his best shot at becoming a comedian. After several months of this lifestyle-washing in public bathrooms, eating fast food-he had considered giving up. Before calling his mother to ask if he could stay with her, he checked his voicemail. The Apollo Theatre wanted him to perform! Great opportunity, but Steve did not have enough money for gas to get from Tennessee to New York. He prayed about it, as he was too proud to ask for money. The following day he had a message from a club in Florida. The audience loved him so much they asked Steve back for a second night. The gig provided him enough money to fly to New York. Although he had no place to stay, walking around all night with a bag that held everything that he owned, it did not get him down.In his new book, Act Like a Success, Think Like a Success, Steve explains this as a âPushback, Pushforwardâ moment. He believes we all have these kinds of situations in life when we have to make a conscious decision to move forward with our dream or walk away. He also believes that anyone aspiring for a better life should be prepared for accidents. This means that one should constantly work on developing their gift, the gift that God has given each of us, so that when opportunities arise we will be ready. Steve addresses discipline-sleeping a maximum of five hours a night. Anyone who sleeps more is not serious about getting the rewards life has to offer. He also discusses concepts of work versus effort and rich versus success. He focuses on taking the lid off the jar. In other words, remove messages from yourself and others that will limit dreams.Act Like a Success, Think Like a Success is a book about success that is rich with anecdotes from Steveâs lifeâfrom sleeping in his car to becoming the $40 million dollar man!

Addiction by Design,Natasha Dow SchÃ¼ll,/books/addiction-by-design,"Recent decades have seen a dramatic shift away from social forms of gambling played around roulette wheels and card tables to solitary gambling at electronic terminals. ""Addiction by Design"" takes readers into the intriguing world of machine gambling, an increasingly popular and absorbing form of play that blurs the line between human and machine, compulsion and control, risk and reward.Drawing on fifteen years of field research in Las Vegas, anthropologist Natasha Dow Schull shows how the mechanical rhythm of electronic gambling pulls players into a trancelike state they call the ""machine zone,"" in which daily worries, social demands, and even bodily awareness fade away. Once in the zone, gambling addicts play not to win but simply to keep playing, for as long as possible--even at the cost of physical and economic exhaustion. In continuous machine play, gamblers seek to lose themselves while the gambling industry seeks profit. Schull describes the strategic calculations behind game algorithms and machine ergonomics, casino architecture and ""ambience management,"" player tracking and cash access systems--all designed to meet the market's desire for maximum ""time on device."" Her account moves from casino floors into gamblers' everyday lives, from gambling industry conventions and Gamblers Anonymous meetings to regulatory debates over whether addiction to gambling machines stems from the consumer, the product, or the interplay between the two.""Addiction by Design"" is a compelling inquiry into the intensifying traffic between people and machines of chance, offering clues to some of the broader anxieties and predicaments of contemporary life.","['non-fiction', 'psychology', 'science & nature', 'design', 'technology']",2,2023-12-22 00:00:00

It comprises 9,896 lines in dactylic hexameter. The first six of the poem's twelve books tell the story of Aeneas's wanderings from Troy to Italy, and the poem's second half tells of the Trojans' ultimately victorious war upon the Latins, under whose name Aeneas and his Trojan followers are destined to be subsumed. The hero Aeneas was already known to Greco-Roman legend and myth, having been a character in the Iliad.Virgil took the disconnected tales of Aeneas's wanderings, his vague association with the foundation of Rome and a personage of no fixed characteristics other than a scrupulous pietas, and fashioned this into a compelling founding myth or national epic that at once tied Rome to the legends of Troy, explained the Punic Wars, glorified traditional Roman virtues, and legitimized the Julio-Claudian dynasty as descendants of the founders, heroes, and gods of Rome and Troy.

However, with advances in neurobiology and neuroscience, researchers are demonstrating that this position is wrong as they move closer to a lasting understanding of the biology and psychology of emotion. In Affective Neuroscience, Jaak Panksepp provides the most up to date information about the brain operating systems that organize the fundamental emotional tendencies of all mammals. Presenting complex material in a readable manner, the book offers a comprehensive summary of the fundamental neural sources of human and animal feelings, as well as a conceptual framework for studying emotional systems of the brain.Panksepp approaches emotions from the perspective of basic emotion theory but does not fail to address the complex issues raised by constructionist approaches. These issues include relations to human consciousness and the psychiatric implications of this knowledge. The book includes chapters on sleep and arousal, pleasure and fear systems, the sources of rage and anger, and the neural control of sexuality, as well as the more subtle emotions related to maternal care, social loss, and playfulness.

Against Empathy,Paul Bloom,/books/against-empathy,"We often think of our capacity to experience the suffering of others as the ultimate source of goodness. Many of our wisest policy-makers, activists, scientists, and philosophers agree that the only problem with empathy is that we donât have enough of it.Nothing could be farther from the truth, argues Yale researcher Paul Bloom. In AGAINST EMPATHY, Bloom reveals empathy to be one of the leading motivators of inequality and immorality in society. Far from helping us to improve the lives of others, empathy is a capricious and irrational emotion that appeals to our narrow prejudices. It muddles our judgment and, ironically, often leads to cruelty. We are at our best when we are smart enough not to rely on it, but to draw instead upon a more distanced compassion.Basing his argument on groundbreaking scientific findings, Bloom makes the case that some of the worst decisions made by individuals and nationsâwho to give money to, when to go to war, how to respond to climate change, and who to imprisonâare too often motivated by honest, yet misplaced, emotions. With precision and wit, he demonstrates how empathy distorts our judgment in every aspect of our lives, from philanthropy and charity to the justice system; from medical care and education to parenting and marriage. Without empathy, Bloom insists, our decisions would be clearer, fairer, andâyesâultimately more moral.Brilliantly argued, urgent and humane, AGAINST EMPATHY shows us that, when it comes to both major policy decisions and the choices we make in our everyday lives, limiting our impulse toward empathy is often the most compassionate choice we can make.","['non-fiction', 'psychology', 'philosophy', 'science & nature', 'economics & politics']",1,2020-11-03 00:00:00

Peter Bernstein has written a comprehensive history of man's efforts to understand risk and probability, beginning with early gamblers in ancient Greece, continuing through the 17th-century French mathematicians Pascal and Fermat and up to modern chaos theory. Along the way he demonstrates that understanding risk underlies everything from game theory to bridge-building to winemaking.","['non-fiction', 'economics & politics', 'business & management', 'money & investing', 'history']",6,2023-12-22 00:00:00
Age and Guile,P.J.

The #1 New York Timesâbestselling author of Give War a Chance was at one time a raving pinko, with scars on his formerly bleeding heart to prove it. In Age and Guile: Beat Youth, Innocence, and a Bad Haircut, P. J. OâRourke chronicles the remarkable trajectory that took him from the lighthearted fun of the revolutionary barricades to the serious business of the nineteenth hole. How did the OâRourke of 1970, who summarized the world of âgrown-upsâ as âmaterialism, sexual hang-ups, the Republican party, uncomfortable clothes, engagement rings, car accidents, Pat Boone, competition, patriotism, cheating, lying, ranch houses, and TVâ come to be in favor of all of those things? What caused his metamorphosis from a beatnik-hippie type comfortable sleeping on dirty mattresses in pot-addled communes during his days as a writer for assorted âundergroundâ papers? Here, OâRourke shows how his socialist idealism and avant-garde aesthetic tendencies were cured, and how he acquired a healthy and commendable interest in national defense, balanced budgets, Porsches, and Cohiba cigars. From a former editor-in-chief of National Lampoon and frequent NPR guest, this hilarious essay collection shows that thereâs hope for all those suffering from acute bohemianism.","['non-fiction', 'arts & entertainment', 'economics & politics']",1,2023-12-22 00:00:00

What we don't see is how both powerful and ordinary people are remaking their lives as their country dramatically changes.As the Beijing correspondent for The New Yorker, Evan Osnos was on the ground in China for years, witness to profound political, economic, and cultural upheaval. In Age of Ambition, he describes the greatest collision taking place in that country: the clash between the rise of the individual and the Communist Party's struggle to retain control. He asks probing questions: Why does a government with more success lifting people from poverty than any civilization in history choose to put strict restraints on freedom of expression? Why do millions of young Chinese professionals-fluent in English and devoted to Western pop culture-consider themselves ""angry youth,"" dedicated to resisting the West's influence? How are Chinese from all strata finding meaning after two decades of the relentless pursuit of wealth?Writing with great narrative verve and a keen sense of irony, Osnos follows the moving stories of everyday people and reveals life in the new China to be a battleground between aspiration and authoritarianism, in which only one can prevail.","['non-fiction', 'economics & politics']",2,2023-12-22 00:00:00

Alexander Hamilton,Ron Chernow,/books/alexander-hamilton,"A New York Times Bestseller, and the inspiration for the hit Broadway musical Hamilton!Pulitzer Prize-winning author Ron Chernow presents a landmark biography of Alexander Hamilton, the Founding Father who galvanized, inspired, scandalized, and shaped the newborn nation.In the first full-length biography of Alexander Hamilton in decades, Ron Chernow tells the riveting story of a man who overcame all odds to shape, inspire, and scandalize the newborn America. According to historian Joseph Ellis, Alexander Hamilton is âa robust full-length portrait, in my view the best ever written, of the most brilliant, charismatic and dangerous founder of them all.âFew figures in American history have been more hotly debated or more grossly misunderstood than Alexander Hamilton. Chernowâs biography gives Hamilton his due and sets the record straight, deftly illustrating that the political and economic greatness of todayâs America is the result of Hamiltonâs countless sacrifices to champion ideas that were often wildly disputed during his time. âTo repudiate his legacy,â Chernow writes, âis, in many ways, to repudiate the modern world.â Chernow here recounts Hamiltonâs turbulent life: an illegitimate, largely self-taught orphan from the Caribbean, he came out of nowhere to take America by storm, rising to become George Washingtonâs aide-de-camp in the Continental Army, coauthoring The Federalist Papers, founding the Bank of New York, leading the Federalist Party, and becoming the first Treasury Secretary of the United States.Historians have long told the story of Americaâs birth as the triumph of Jeffersonâs democratic ideals over the aristocratic intentions of Hamilton. Chernow presents an entirely different man, whose legendary ambitions were motivated not merely by self-interest but by passionate patriotism and a stubborn will to build the foundations of American prosperity and power. His is a Hamilton far more human than weâve encountered beforeâfrom his shame about his birth to his fiery aspirations, from his intimate relationships with childhood friends to his titanic feuds with Jefferson, Madison, Adams, Monroe, and Burr, and from his highly public affair with Maria Reynolds to his loving marriage to his loyal wife Eliza. And never before has there been a more vivid account of Hamiltonâs famous and mysterious death in a duel with Aaron Burr in July of 1804.Chernowâs biography is not just a portrait of Hamilton, but the story of Americaâs birth seen through its most central figure. At a critical time to look back to our roots, Alexander Hamilton will remind readers of the purpose of our institutions and our heritage as Americans.âNobody has captured Hamilton better than Chernowâ âThe New York Times Book Review Ron Chernow's other biographies include: Grant, Washington, and Titan.","['non-fiction', 'biographies & memoirs', 'economics & politics', 'history']",3,2023-12-22 00:00:00

As allusive as the Cantos, as aggressive as a circular saw, this debut collection will offend none but the virtuous.""Every once in a while, a book appears as if out of nowhere, uncanny in its authority, combining the shock of the new with the shock of recognition. Michael Robbins's Alien vs. Predator has given me a sense of what early readers of The Waste Land must have felt in 1922, what it must have been like to pick up a copy of Wise Blood at the bookstore in 1952.""--John Wilson, Commonweal""You don't get the instant satisfaction you might expect from a poet hungrily stalking the moment; Robbins's poems have their own distinctly contemporary appeal: They slowly develop into embarrassing pictures of ourselves. They aren't just shiny and fun, they're also sharp -- which makes them quite dangerous.""--The Boston Globe""The first important poet whose work can be appreciated only with an Internet connection, Robbins is a lot more than the first 'Google poet.' He is also a significant new poetic voice and, quite possibly, a living poet with a chance of developing a genuine popular following.""--The Weekly Standard""If later John Ashbery and David McGimpsey have proven that capitalist popular culture is a suitable subject for poetry, Robbins goes a step further and attempts its formal mimesis. And he does it really goddamn well.""--The National Post","['fiction', 'arts & entertainment']",1,2023-12-22 00:00:00
Alive at Work,Dan Cable,/books/alive-at-work,"Poll after poll has confirmed that an astonishing number of workers are disengaged from their work. Why is this happening? And how can we fix the problem?In this bold, enlightening book, social psychologist and professor Daniel M. Cable takes leaders into the minds of workers and reveals the surprising secret to restoring their zest for work.Disengagement isn't a motivational problem, it's a biological one. Humans aren't built for routine and repetition. We're designed to crave exploration, experimentation, and learning--in fact, there's a part of our brains, which scientists have coined ""the seeking system,"" that rewards us for taking part in these activities. But the way organizations are run prevents many of us from following our innate impulses. As a result, we shut down.Things need to change. More than ever before, employee creativity and engagement are needed to win. Fortunately, it won't take an extensive overhaul of your organizational culture to get started. With small nudges, you can personally help people reach their fullest potential.","['non-fiction', 'business & management', 'psychology']",1,2020-10-24 00:00:00
All About Love,Bell Hooks,/books/all-about-love,"The acclaimed first volume in bell hooks' ""Love Song to the Nation""âThe word âloveâ is most often defined as a noun, yet . . . we would all love better if we used it as a verb,â writes bell hooks as she comes out fighting and on fire in All About Love. Here, at her most provocative and intensely personal, bell hooks (renowned scholar, cultural critic, and feminist) skewers our view of love as romance. In its place she offers a proactive new ethic for a people and a society bereft with lovelessness.As bell hooks uses her incisive mind and razor-sharp pen to explore the question âWhat is love?â her answers strike at both the mind and heart. In thirteen concise chapters, hooks examines her own search for emotional connection and societyâs failure to provide a model for learning to love. Razing the cultural paradigm that the ideal love is infused with sex and desire, she provides a new path to love that is sacred, redemptive, and healing for individuals and for a nation. The Utne Reader declared bell hooks one of the â100 Visionaries Who Can Change Your Life.â All About Love is a powerful affirmation of just how profoundly she can.","['non-fiction', 'economics & politics', 'philosophy']",2,2023-12-22 00:00:00
All In,Paula Broadwell,/books/all-in,"General David Petraeus is the most transformative leader the American military has seen since the generation of Marshall. In the New York Times bestseller All In, military expert Paula Broadwell examines Petraeus's career, his intellectual development as a military officer, and his impact on the U.S. military.Afforded extensive access by General Petraeus, his mentors, his subordinates, and his longtime friends, Broadwell reported on the front lines of fighting and at the strategic command in Afghanistan to chronicle the experiences of this American general as they were brought to bear in the terrible crucible of war. All In draws on hundreds of hours of exclusive interviews with Petraeus and his top officers and soldiers to tell the inside story of this commander's development and leadership in war.When Petraeus assumed command in Afghanistan in July 2010, the conflict looked as bleak as at any moment in America's nine years on the ground there. Petraeus's defining ideaâcounterinsurgencyâwas immediate put to its most difficult test: the hard lessons learned during the surge in Iraq were to be applied in a radically different theater. All In examines the impact in Afghanistan of new counterinsurgency as well as counterterrorism strategies through the commands of several Petraeus protÃ©gÃ©s.Broadwell examines his evolution as a solider from his education at West Point in the wake of Vietnam to his earlier service in Central America, Haiti, Kuwait, Bosnia, and Iraq. All In also documents the general's role in the war in Washington, going behind the scenes of negotiations during policy reviews of the war in Afghanistan in Congress, the Pentagon, and the White House.Broadwell ultimately appraises Petraeus's impact on the entire U.S. military: Thanks to this man's influence, the military is better prepared to fight using a comprehensive blend of civil-military activities. As America surveys a decade of untraditional warfare, this much is clear: The career of General David Petraeus profoundly shaped our military and left an indelible mark on its rising leaders.","['non-fiction', 'biographies & memoirs', 'history', 'economics & politics']",1,2020-09-27 00:00:00
All Marketers are Liars,Seth Godin,/books/all-marketers-are-liars,"Every marketer tells a story. We'll believe them if they do it correctly. We believe that a $20 glass of wine tastes better than a $1 glass of wine. An $80,000 Porsche, in our opinion, is far preferable to a $36,000 Volkswagen that is basically the same automobile. We believe that $225 sneakers feel and look better on our feet than a $25 pair. And it's only true if you believe it.Great marketers don't talk about features or even benefits, as Seth Godin has taught hundreds of thousands of marketers and students across the world. Rather, they convey a storyâone that we want to believe, whether or not it's true.Every company is a marketer, and all marketing is about telling stories in a world where most people have an endless amount of options and little time to make them.âMarketers thrive when they present us a tale that suits our worldview, one that we intuitively embrace and then tell our friends about. Consider Dyson vacuum cleaners, Fiji water, or iPods.âBut be careful: if your stories are false, you've crossed the line into fraud. Marketers fail when they are self-serving and deceptive, when they abuse their trade's instruments and make the world a worse place. Telemarketers, tobacco corporations, and corrupt politicians have all learned this the hard way.For the rest of us, though, it's time to embrace the story's power. ""Stories make it simpler to grasp the world,"" writes Godin. We realise that the best way to disseminate a concept is via stories. Storytelling was not invented by marketers.

All Out War,Tim Shipman,/books/all-out-war-tim-shipman,"Politics was turned upside down during 2016. This book by Sunday Times political editor Tim Shipman is the first to tell the full story of how and why Britain voted to leave the European Union and how the vote shattered the political status quo.Based on unrivalled access to all the key politicians and their advisors â including Boris Johnson, Michael Gove, George Osborne, Nigel Farage and Dominic Cummings, the mastermind of Vote Leave â Shipman has written a political history that reads like a thriller, and offers a gripping, day-by-day account of what really happened behind-the-scenes in Downing Street, both Leave campaigns, the Labour Party, Ukip and Britain Stronger in Europe.Shipman gives his readers a ringside seat on how decisions were made, mistakes justified and betrayals perpetrated. Filled with stories, anecdotes and juicy leaks the book does not seek to address the rights and wrongs of Brexit but to explore how and why David Cameron chose to take the biggest political gamble of his life and explain why he lost.This is a story of calculation, attempted coups, individuals torn between principles and loyalty. All the events are here â from David Cameronâs pledge to hold a referendum, through to the campaign itself, his resignation as prime minister, the betrayals and rivalries that occurred during the race to find his successor to the arrival of Theresa May in Downing Street as Britainâs second female prime minister.âAll Out War is a book about leaders and their closest aides, the decisions they make and how and why they make them, as well as how they feel when they turn out to be wrong. It is about men who make decisions that are intellectually consistent and â by their own measure â morally sound that are simultaneously disastrous for themselves and those closest to them. It is about how doing what you know has worked before doesnât always work again. Most of all it is about asking the question: how far are you prepared to go to win?","['non-fiction', 'economics & politics']",1,2023-12-22 00:00:00

It is the story of Bragg's father, a hard-drinking man with a murderous temper and the habit of running out on the people who needed him most.But at the center of this soaring memoir is Bragg's mother, who went eighteen years without a new dress so that her sons could have school clothes and picked other people's cotton so that her children wouldn't have to live on welfare alone. Evoking these lives--and the country that shaped and nourished them--with artistry, honesty, and compassion, Rick Bragg brings home the love and suffering that lie at the heart of every family. The result is unforgettable.","['non-fiction', 'biographies & memoirs']",1,2023-12-22 00:00:00

I am a Carr.Dad: That should matter quite a bit, actually not the name but the guts of what that name means.âA celebrated journalist, bestselling author (The Night of the Gun), and recovering addict, David Carr was in the prime of his career when he suffered a fatal collapse in the newsroom of The New York Times in 2015.

How could she fill the space left behind by a man who had come to embody journalistic integrity, rigor, and hard reporting, whose mentorship meant everything not just to her but to the many who served alongside him?âAll That You Leave Behind is a poignant coming-of-age story that offers a raw and honest glimpse into the multilayered relationship between a daughter and a father.

Alone Against the North: An Expedition into the Unknown,Adam Shoalts,/books/alone-against-the-north,"When Adam Shoalts ventured into the largest unexplored wilderness on the planet, he hoped to set foot where no one had ever gone before. What he discovered surprised even him.Shoalts was no stranger to the wilderness. He had hacked his way through jungles and swamp, had stared down polar bears and climbed mountains. But one spot on the map called out to him irresistibly: the Hudson Bay Lowlands, a trackless expanse of muskeg and lonely rivers, caribou and wolfâan Amazon of the north, parts of which to this day remain unexplored. Cutting through this forbidding landscape is a river no explorer, trapper, or canoeist had left any record of paddling. It was this river that Shoalts was obsessively determined to explore. It took him several attempts, and years of research. But finally, alone, he found the headwaters of the mysterious river. He believed he had discovered what he had set out to find. But the adventure had just begun. Unexpected dangers awaited him downstream. Gripping and often poetic, Alone Against the North is a classic adventure story of single-minded obsession, physical hardship, and the restless sense of wonder that every explorer has in common. But what does exploration mean in an age when satellite imagery of even the remotest corner of the planet is available to anyone with a phone? Is there anything left to explore? What Shoalts discovered as he paddled downriver was a series of unmapped waterfalls that could easily have killed him. Just as astonishing was the media reaction when he got back to civilization. He was crowned âCanadaâs Indiana Jonesâ and appeared on morning television. He was feted by the Royal Canadian Geographical Society and congratulated by the Governor General. People were enthralled by Shoaltsâs proof that the world is bigger than we think. Shoalts's story makes it clear that the world can become known only by getting out of our cars and armchairs, and setting out into the unknown, where every step is different from the one before, and something you may never have imagined lies around the next curve in the river.

Alpha Girls,Julian Guthrie,/books/alpha-girls,"An unforgettable story of four women who, through grit and ingenuity, became stars in the cutthroat, high-stakes, male dominated world of venture capital in Silicon Valley, and helped build some of the foremost companies of our time.In Alpha Girls, award-winning journalist Julian Guthrie takes readers behind the closed doors of venture capital, an industry that transforms economies and shapes how we live. We follow the lives and careers of four women who were largely written out of history - until now.Magdalena Yesil, who arrived in America from Turkey with $43 to her name, would go on to receive her electrical engineering degree from Stanford, found some of the first companies to commercialize internet access, and help Marc Benioff build Salesforce. Mary Jane Elmore went from the corn fields of Indiana to Stanford and on to the storied venture capital firm IVP - where she was one of the first women in the U.S. to make partner - only to be pulled back from the glass ceiling by expectations at home. Theresia Gouw, an overachieving first-generation Asian American from a working-class town, dominated the foosball tables at Brown (she would later reluctantly let Sergey Brin win to help Accel Partners court Google), before she helped land and build companies including Facebook, Trulia, Imperva, and ForeScout. Sonja Hoel, a Southerner who became the first woman investing partner at white-glove Menlo Ventures, invested in McAfee, Hotmail, Acme Packet, and F5 Networks. As her star was still rising at Menlo, a personal crisis would turn her into an activist overnight, inspiring her to found an all-women's investment group and a national nonprofit for girls.These women, juggling work and family, shaped the tech landscape we know today while overcoming unequal pay, actual punches, betrayals, and the sexist attitudes prevalent in Silicon Valley and in male-dominated industries everywhere. Despite the setbacks, they would rise again to rewrite the rules for an industry they love.

Tart,/books/altered-states-of-consciousness,"The study of the nature of human consciousness, a dormant and often taboo topic in psychology, is once again developing into a respected field of inquiry. This is the first book to provide a broad scientific point of view for the investigation of a variety of special states of consciousness.The editor combines a humanistic approach, which includes an awareness of the great potential richness in human experience indicated by ASCs, with the disciplined precision of a scientist. He brings a professional point of view to the observation of the increasingly widespread use and resultant effects of drug, Yoga, self-hypnosis, and other means of producing ASCs which are popularly regarded as comprising either a major social problem or a sign of positive change in a materialistic civilization.Studies of ASCs produced by psychedlic drugs, for example, are placed in this book within a broad, illuminating perspective that includes papers on mystical experiences, hypnagogic (between waking and sleeping) states, dream consciousness, meditation, hypnosis, and brain wave feedback-produced states.In this volume, Professor Tart has brought together 35 scientific papers which illustrate the variety of ASCs and their effects, which describe some of the techniques, both ancient and modern, for producing ASCs and, perhaps most important, which show that ASCs can be studied scientifically without destroying their inherent human richness.","['non-fiction', 'science & nature', 'philosophy', 'psychology']",1,2023-12-22 00:00:00
Altered Traits,Daniel Goleman,/books/altered-traits,"Two New York Timesâbestselling authors unveil new research showing what meditation can really do for the brain. In the last twenty years, meditation and mindfulness have gone from being kind of cool to becoming an omnipresent Band-Aid for fixing everything from your weight to your relationship to your achievement level. Unveiling here the kind of cutting-edge research that has made them giants in their fields, Daniel Goleman and Richard Davidson show us the truth about what meditation can really do for us, as well as exactly how to get the most out of it.Sweeping away common misconceptions and neuromythology to open readersâ eyes to the ways data has been distorted to sell mind-training methods, the authors demonstrate that beyond the pleasant states mental exercises can produce, the real payoffs are the lasting personality traits that can result. But short daily doses will not get us to the highest level of lasting positive changeâeven if we continue for yearsâwithout specific additions. More than sheer hours, we need smart practice, including crucial ingredients such as targeted feedback from a master teacher and a more spacious, less attached view of the self, all of which are missing in widespread versions of mind training. The authors also reveal the latest data from Davidsonâs own lab that point to a new methodology for developing a broader array of mind-training methods with larger implications for how we can derive the greatest benefits from the practice.Exciting, compelling, and grounded in new research, this is one of those rare books that has the power to change us at the deepest level.","['non-fiction', 'science & nature', 'self improvement', 'health & fitness']",2,2023-12-22 00:00:00
Am I Being Too Subtle?,Sam Zell,/books/am-i-being-too-subtle,"Self-made billionaire Sam Zell consistently sees what others donât. From finding a market for overpriced Playboy magazines among his junior high classmates, to buying real estate on the cheap after a market crash, to investing in often unglamorous industries with long-term value, Zell acts boldly on supply and demand trends to grab the first-mover advantage. And he can find opportunity virtually anywhereâfrom an arcane piece of legislation to a desert meeting in Abu Dhabi.âIf everyone is going left, look right,â Zell often says. To him, conventional wisdom is nothing but a reference point. Year after year, deal after deal, he shuts out the noise of the crowd, gathers as much information as possible, then trusts his own instincts. He credits much of his independent thinking to his parents, who were Jewish refugees from World War II.Talk to any two people and you might get wild swings in their descriptions of Zell. A media firestorm ensued when the Tribune Company went into bankruptcy a year after he agreed to steward the enterprise. At the same time, his razor-sharp instincts are legendary on Wall Street, and he has sponsored over a dozen IPOs. Â Heâs known as the Grave Dancer for his strategy of targeting troubled assets, yet heâs created thousands of jobs. Within his own organization, he has an inordinate number of employees at every level who are fiercely loyal and have worked for him for decades.Zellâs got a big personality; he is often contrarian, blunt, and irreverent, and always curious and hardworking. This is the guy who started wearing jeans to work in the 1960s, when offices were a sea of gray suits. Heâs the guy who told TheWall Street Journal in 1985, âIf it ainât fun, we donât do it.â He rides motorcycles with his friends, the Zellâs Angels, around the world and he keeps ducks on the deck outside his office.As he writes: âI simply donât buy into many of the made-up rules of social convention. The bottom line is: If youâre really good at what you do, you have the freedom to be who you really are.âAm I Being Too Subtle?âa reference to Zellâs favorite way to underscore a pointâtakes readers on a ride across his business terrain, sharing with honesty and humor stories of the times he got it right, when he didnât, and most important, what he learned in the process. This is an indispensable guide for the next generation of disrupters, entrepreneurs, and investors.","['non-fiction', 'business & management']",1,2023-11-21 00:00:00

American Kingpin,Nick Bilton,/books/american-kingpin,"The unbelievable true story of the man who built a billion-dollar online drug empire from his bedroomâand almost got away with it.In 2011, a twenty-six-year-old libertarian programmer named Ross Ulbricht launched the ultimate free market: the Silk Road, a clandestine Web site hosted on the Dark Web where anyone could trade anythingâdrugs, hacking software, forged passports, counterfeit cash, poisonsâfree of the governmentâs watchful eye.It wasnât long before the media got wind of the new Web site where anyoneânot just teenagers and weed dealers but terrorists and black hat hackersâcould buy and sell contraband detection-free. Spurred by a public outcry, the federal government launched an epic two-year manhunt for the siteâs elusive proprietor, with no leads, no witnesses, and no clear jurisdiction. All the investigators knew was that whoever was running the site called himself the Dread Pirate Roberts.The Silk Road quickly ballooned into $1.2 billion enterprise, and Ross embraced his new role as kingpin. He enlisted a loyal crew of allies in high and low places, all as addicted to the danger and thrill of running an illegal marketplace as their customers were to the heroin they sold. Through his network he got wind of the target on his back and took drastic steps to protect himselfâincluding ordering a hit on a former employee. As Ross made plans to disappear forever, the Feds raced against the clock to catch a man they werenât sure even existed, searching for a needle in the haystack of the global Internet.Drawing on exclusive access to key players and two billion digital words and images Ross left behind, Vanity Fair correspondent and New York Times bestselling author Nick Bilton offers a tale filled with twists and turns, lucky breaks and unbelievable close calls.

American Like Me,America Ferrera,/books/american-like-me,"A vivid and varied collection of first-person experiences from important personalities about the experience of growing up between cultures, edited by award-winning actress and political activist America Ferrera.America Ferrera has always felt completely American, yet her identity is closely tied to her parents' origin and culture in Honduras. At home, she spoke Spanish, had Saturday morning salsa dance parties in the kitchen, and ate tamales alongside apple pie for Christmas.Nonetheless, she desired for her identity to be mirrored in the wider American story.Now, in American Like Me, America asks thirty-one of her friends, classmates, and idols to give their perspectives on cross-cultural life. Actors, comedians, sportsmen, politicians, artists, and authors are some of the people we are familiar with. They are, however, immigrants, children or grandchildren of immigrants, indigenous peoples, or those who grew up with strong personal ties to several cultures.

And they identify as Americans with zeal, reluctance, or no enthusiasm.Their experiences, which range from touching to funny, shed light on a uniquely American experience and will appeal to anybody who has struggled with family, culture, or growing up.","['non-fiction', 'biographies & memoirs']",1,2023-12-22 00:00:00
American Lion,Jon Meacham,/books/american-lion,"The definitive biography of a larger-than-life president who defied norms, divided a nation, and changed Washington forever.Andrew Jackson, his intimate circle of friends, and his tumultuous times are at the heart of this remarkable book about the man who rose from nothing to create the modern presidency. Beloved and hated, venerated and reviled, Andrew Jackson was an orphan who fought his way to the pinnacle of power, bending the nation to his will in the cause of democracy. Jacksonâs election in 1828 ushered in a new and lasting era in which the people, not distant elites, were the guiding force in American politics. Democracy made its stand in the Jackson years, and he gave voice to the hopes and the fears of a restless, changing nation facing challenging times at home and threats abroad. To tell the saga of Jacksonâs presidency, acclaimed author Jon Meacham goes inside the Jackson White House. Drawing on newly discovered family letters and papers, he details the human dramaâthe family, the women, and the inner circle of advisersâ that shaped Jacksonâs private world through years of storm and victory.One of our most significant yet dimly recalled presidents, Jackson was a battle-hardened warrior, the founder of the Democratic Party, and the architect of the presidency as we know it. His story is one of violence, sex, courage, and tragedy. With his powerful persona, his evident bravery, and his mystical connection to the people, Jackson moved the White House from the periphery of government to the center of national action, articulating a vision of change that challenged entrenched interests to heed the popular willâ or face his formidable wrath. The greatest of the presidents who have followed Jackson in the White Houseâfrom Lincoln to Theodore Roosevelt to FDR to Trumanâhave found inspiration in his example, and virtue in his vision.Jackson was the most contradictory of men. The architect of the removal of Indians from their native lands, he was warmly sentimental and risked everything to give more power to ordinary citizens. He was, in short, a lot like his country: alternately kind and vicious, brilliant and blind; and a man who fought a lifelong war to keep the republic safeâno matter what it took.","['non-fiction', 'biographies & memoirs', 'economics & politics', 'history']",1,2023-12-22 00:00:00

American Nations,Colin Woodard,/books/american-nations,"An illuminating history of North America's eleven rival cultural regions that explodes the red state-blue state myth. North America was settled by people with distinct religious, political, and ethnographic characteristics, creating regional cultures that have been at odds with one another ever since. Subsequent immigrants didn't confront or assimilate into an ""American"" or ""Canadian"" culture, but rather into one of the eleven distinct regional ones that spread over the continent each staking out mutually exclusive territory.In American Nations, Colin Woodard leads us on a journey through the history of our fractured continent, and the rivalries and alliances between its component nations, which conform to neither state nor international boundaries. He illustrates and explains why ""American"" values vary sharply from one region to another. Woodard reveals how intranational differences have played a pivotal role at every point in the continent's history, from the American Revolution and the Civil War to the tumultuous sixties and the ""blue county/red county"" maps of recent presidential elections.

American Prison,Shane Bauer,/books/american-prison,"A ground-breaking and fearless inside look at the link between jail and business in America, both in one Louisiana prison and throughout the history of our country.Shane Bauer was employed as an entry-level prison guard at a private jail in Winnfield, Louisiana, in 2014 at $9 an hour. He used his true name, despite being an award-winning investigative journalist, and there was no substantial background check. His position ended abruptly four months later. But he'd had enough, and he published an exposÃ© about his experiences that won a National Magazine Award and went on to become the most-read piece in Mother Jones' history. There was still a lot more he needed to say. In American Prison, Bauer mixes a far more in-depth examination of his own experiences with a well-researched history of for-profit prisons in America, dating back to the decades before the Civil War. We can't grasp the harshness of our current system and its role in the greater saga of mass imprisonment without first understanding where it originated from, as he quickly understood. In the aftermath of slavery, private prisons grew established in the South as part of a systemic attempt to keep the African-American work force in place, and the echoes of these sordid roots may still be heard today.The private jail system is purposefully shielded from public scrutiny. Private prisons are not rewarded for caring for its inmates' health, feeding them well, or attracting and retaining a well-trained jail staff. Bauer befriends some of his coworkers and sympathises with their predicament, but their lives' chronic dysfunction just adds to the prison's instability. Bauer discovers that the longer he works at the jail, the crueller and more violent he becomes, and he is far from alone.American Prison is an important human narrative on the actual face of justice in America. It is a scorching critique of the private prison system and the overwhelming forces that drive it.","['non-fiction', 'economics & politics']",1,2023-12-22 00:00:00

"American Slavery, American Freedom",Edmund S. Morgan,/books/american-slavery-american-freedom,"In the American Revolution, Virginians were the most eloquent spokesmen for freedom and quality. George Washington led the Americans in battle against British oppression. Thomas Jefferson led them in declaring independence. Virginians drafted not only the Declaration but also the Constitution and the Bill of Rights; they were elected to the presidency of the United States under that Constitution for thirty-two of the first thirty-six years of its existence. They were all slaveholders. In the new preface Edmund S. Morgan writes: ""Human relations among us still suffer from the former enslavement of a large portion of our predecessors.The freedom of the free, the growth of freedom experienced in the American Revolution depended more than we like to admit on the enslavement of more than 20 percent of us at that time. How republican freedom came to be supported, at least in large part, by its opposite, slavery, is the subject of this book. American Slavery, American Freedom is a study of the tragic contradiction at the core of America. Morgan finds the keys to this central paradox, ""the marriage of slavery and freedom,"" in the people and the politics of the state that was both the birthplace of the Revolution and the largest slaveholding state in the country.","['non-fiction', 'history', 'economics & politics']",1,2020-10-29 00:00:00

Americana: A 400-Year History of American Capitalism,Bhu Srinivasan,/books/americana,"From the days of the Mayflower and the Virginia Company, America has been a place for people to dream, invent, build, tinker, and bet the farm in pursuit of a better life. Americana takes us on a 400-year journey of this spirit of innovation and ambition through a series of Next Big Things - the inventions, techniques, and industries that drove American history forward: from the telegraph, the railroad, guns, radio, and banking, to flight, suburbia, and sneakers, culminating with the Internet and mobile technology at the turn of the 21st century. The result is a thrilling alternative history of modern America that reframes events, trends, and people we thought we knew through the prism of the value that, for better or for worse, this nation holds dearest: capitalism. In a winning, accessible style, Bhu Srinivasan boldly takes on four centuries of American enterprise, revealing the unexpected connections that link them. We learn how Andrew Carnegie's early job as a telegraph messenger boy paved the way for his leadership of the steel empire that would make him one of the nation's richest men; how the gunmaker Remington reinvented itself in the postwar years to sell typewriters; how the inner workings of the Mafia mirrored the trend of consolidation and regulation in more traditional business; and how a 1950s infrastructure bill triggered a series of events that produced one of America's most enduring brands: KFC. Reliving the heady early days of Silicon Valley, we are reminded that the start-up is an idea as old as America itself. Entertaining, eye-opening, and sweeping in its reach, Americana is an exhilarating new work of narrative history.","['economics & politics', 'history']",1,2022-01-04 00:00:00

Amusing Ourselves to Death,Neil Postman,/books/amusing-ourselves-to-death,"Television has conditioned us to tolerate visually entertaining material measured out in spoonfuls of time, to the detriment of rational public discourse and reasoned public affairs.

Delighted by its appearance and craftsmanship--like a ten-foot-tall Transformer wearing a suit of samurai armor--April and her best friend, Andy, make a video with it, which Andy uploads to YouTube. The next day, April wakes up to a viral video and a new life. News quickly spreads that there are Carls in dozens of cities around the world--from Beijing to Buenos Aires--and April, as their first documentarian, finds herself at the center of an intense international media spotlight.Seizing the opportunity to make her mark on the world, April now has to deal with the consequences her new particular brand of fame has on her relationships, her safety, and her own identity. And all eyes are on April to figure out not just what the Carls are, but what they want from us.Compulsively entertaining and powerfully relevant, An Absolutely Remarkable Thing grapples with big themes, including how the social internet is changing fame, rhetoric, and radicalization; how our culture deals with fear and uncertainty; and how vilification and adoration spring for the same dehumanization that follows a life in the public eye.

An Appetite for Wonder,Richard Dawkins,/books/an-appetite-for-wonder,"With the 2006 publication of The God Delusion, the name Richard Dawkins became a byword for ruthless skepticism and ""brilliant, impassioned, articulate, impolite"" debate (San Francisco Chronicle). his first memoir offers a more personal view.His first book, The Selfish Gene, caused a seismic shift in the study of biology by proffering the gene-centered view of evolution. It was also in this book that Dawkins coined the term meme, a unit of cultural evolution, which has itself become a mainstay in contemporary culture.In An Appetite for Wonder, Richard Dawkins shares a rare view into his early life, his intellectual awakening at Oxford, and his path to writing The Selfish Gene. He paints a vivid picture of his idyllic childhood in colonial Africa, peppered with sketches of his colorful ancestors, charming parents, and the peculiarities of colonial life right after World War II. At boarding school, despite a near-religious encounter with an Elvis record, he began his career as a skeptic by refusing to kneel for prayer in chapel. Despite some inspired teaching throughout primary and secondary school, it was only when he got to Oxford that his intellectual curiosity took full flight.Arriving at Oxford in 1959, when undergraduates ""left Elvis behind"" for Bach or the Modern Jazz Quartet, Dawkins began to study zoology and was introduced to some of the university's legendary mentors as well as its tutorial system. It's to this unique educational system that Dawkins credits his awakening, as it invited young people to become scholars by encouraging them to pose rigorous questions and scour the library for the latest research rather than textbook ""teaching to"" any kind of test. His career as a fellow and lecturer at Oxford took an unexpected turn when, in 1973, a serious strike in Britain caused prolonged electricity cuts, and he was forced to pause his computer-based research. Provoked by the then widespread misunderstanding of natural selection known as ""group selection"" and inspired by the work of William Hamilton, Robert Trivers, and John Maynard Smith, he began to write a book he called, jokingly, ""my bestseller."" It was, of course, The Selfish Gene.Here, for the first time, is an intimate memoir of the childhood and intellectual development of the evolutionary biologist and world-famous atheist, and the story of how he came to write what is widely held to be one of the most important books of the twentieth century.","['non-fiction', 'science & nature', 'biographies & memoirs']",4,2020-09-27 00:00:00
An Army At Dawn,Rick Atkinson,/books/an-army-at-dawn,"WINNER OF THE PULITZER PRIZE AND NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER.In the first volume of his monumental trilogy about the liberation of Europe in WW II, Pulitzer Prize winner Rick Atkinson tells the riveting story of the war in North AfricaThe liberation of Europe and the destruction of the Third Reich is a story of courage and enduring triumph, of calamity and miscalculation. In this first volume of the Liberation Trilogy, Rick Atkinson shows why no modern reader can understand the ultimate victory of the Allied powers without a grasp of the great drama that unfolded in North Africa in 1942 and 1943. That first year of the Allied war was a pivotal point in American history, the moment when the United States began to act like a great power.Beginning with the daring amphibious invasion in November 1942, An Army at Dawn follows the American and British armies as they fight the French in Morocco and Algeria, and then take on the Germans and Italians in Tunisia. Battle by battle, an inexperienced and sometimes poorly led army gradually becomes a superb fighting force. Central to the tale are the extraordinary but fallible commanders who come to dominate the battlefield: Eisenhower, Patton, Bradley, Montgomery, and Rommel.Brilliantly researched, rich with new material and vivid insights, Atkinson's narrative provides the definitive history of the war in North Africa.","['non-fiction', 'history']",1,2023-12-22 00:00:00

During this time he has broken into a Space Station with a Swiss army knife, disposed of a live snake while piloting a plane, and been temporarily blinded while clinging to the exterior of an orbiting spacecraft. The secret to Col. Hadfield's success-and survival-is an unconventional philosophy he learned at NASA: prepare for the worst-and enjoy every moment of it.In An Astronaut's Guide to Life on Earth, Col. Hadfield takes readers deep into his years of training and space exploration to show how to make the impossible possible.

An Elegant Defense,Matt Richtel,/books/an-elegant-defense,"A magnificently reported and soulfully crafted exploration of the human immune systemâthe key to health and wellness, life and death. An epic, first-of-its-kind book, entwining leading-edge scientific discovery with the intimate stories of four individual lives, by the Pulitzer Prizeâwinning New York Times journalist.A terminal cancer patient rises from the grave. A medical marvel defies HIV. Two women with autoimmunity discover their own bodies have turned against them. Matt Richtel's An Elegant Defense uniquely entwines these intimate stories with scienceâs centuries-long quest to unlock the mysteries of sickness and health, and illuminates the immune system as never before.The immune system is our bodyâs essential defense network, a guardian vigilantly fighting illness, healing wounds, maintaining order and balance, and keeping us alive. Its legion of microscopic foot soldiersâfrom T cells to ânatural killersââpatrols our body, linked by a nearly instantaneous communications grid. It has been honed by evolution over millennia to face an almost infinite array of threats.For all its astonishing complexity, however, the immune system can be easily compromised by fatigue, stress, toxins, advanced age, and poor nutritionâhallmarks of modern lifeâand even by excessive hygiene. Paradoxically, it is a fragile wonder weapon that can turn on our own bodies with startling results, leading today to epidemic levels of autoimmune disorders.Richtel effortlessly guides readers on a scientific detective tale winding from the Black Plague to twentieth-century breakthroughs in vaccination and antibiotics, to the cutting-edge laboratories that are revolutionizing immunologyâperhaps the most extraordinary and consequential medical story of our time. The foundation that Richtel builds makes accessible revelations about cancer immunotherapy, the microbiome, and autoimmune treatments that are changing millions of lives. An Elegant Defense also captures in vivid detail how these powerful therapies, along with our behavior and environment, interact with the immune system, often for the good but always on a razorâs edge that can throw this remarkable system out of balance.Drawing on his groundbreaking reporting for the New York Times and based on extensive new interviews with dozens of world-renowned scientists, Matt Richtel has produced a landmark book, equally an investigation into the deepest riddles of survival and a profoundly human tale that is movingly brought to life through the eyes of his four main characters, each of whom illuminates an essential facet of our âelegant defense.â","['non-fiction', 'science & nature', 'health & fitness']",2,2023-12-22 00:00:00

An Empire of Wealth,John Steele Gordon,/books/an-empire-of-wealth,"Throughout time, from ancient Rome to modern Britain, the great empires built and maintained their dominion through force of arms and political power over alien peoples. In this illuminating work of history, John Steele Gordon tells the extraordinary story of how the United States, a global power without precedent, became the first country to dominate the world through the creation of wealth.The American economy is by far the world's largest, but it is also the most dynamic and innovative. The nation used its English political inheritance, as well as its diverse, ambitious population and seemingly bottomless imagination, to create an unrivaled economy capable of developing more wealth for more and more people as it grows.But America has also been extremely lucky. Far from a guaranteed success, our resilient economy continually suffered through adversity and catastrophes. It survived a profound recession after the Revolution, an unwise decision by Andrew Jackson that left the country without a central bank for nearly eighty years, and the disastrous Great Depression of the 1930s, which threatened to destroy the Republic itself. Having weathered those trials, the economy became vital enough to Americanize the world in recent decades. Virtually every major development in technology in the twentieth century originated in the United States, and as the products of those technologies traveled around the globe, the result was a subtle, peaceful, and pervasive spread of American culture and perspective.","['non-fiction', 'economics & politics', 'history']",1,2023-12-22 00:00:00

An Everyone Culture,Robert Kegan,/books/an-everyone-culture,"A Radical New Model for Unleashing Your Companyâs Potential.In most organizations nearly everyone is doing a second job no one is paying them forânamely, covering their weaknesses, trying to look their best, and managing other peopleâs impressions of them. There may be no greater waste of a companyâs resources. The ultimate cost: neither the organization nor its people are able to realize their full potential.What if a company did everything in its power to create a culture in which everyoneânot just select âhigh potentialsââcould overcome their own internal barriers to change and use errors and vulnerabilities as prime opportunities for personal and company growth?Robert Kegan and Lisa Lahey (and their collaborators) have found and studied such companiesâDeliberately Developmental Organizations. A DDO is organized around the simple but radical conviction that organizations will best prosper when they are more deeply aligned with peopleâs strongest motive, which is to grow. This means going beyond consigning âpeople developmentâ to high-potential programs, executive coaching, or once-a-year off-sites. It means fashioning an organizational culture in which support of peopleâs development is woven into the daily fabric of working life and the companyâs regular operations, daily routines, and conversations.An Everyone Culture dives deep into the worlds of three leading companies that embody this breakthrough approach. It reveals the design principles, concrete practices, and underlying science at the heart of DDOsâfrom their disciplined approach to giving feedback, to how they use meetings, to the distinctive way that managers and leaders define their roles. The authors then show readers how to build this developmental culture in their own organizations.This book demonstrates a whole new way of being at work. It suggests that the culture you create is your strategyâand that the key to success is developing everyone.","['non-fiction', 'business & management']",1,2023-12-22 00:00:00

With this model, Dr. Myss shows how you can develop your own latent powers of intuition as you simultaneously cultivate your personal power and spiritual growth.By teaching you to see your body and spirit in a new way, Anatomy of the Spirit provides you with the tools for spiritual maturity and physical wholeness that will change your life.","['non-fiction', 'spirituality & religion', 'self improvement']",1,2020-10-12 00:00:00

Their host, an eccentric millionaire unknown to all of them, is nowhere to be found. All that the guests have in common is a wicked past they're unwilling to revealâand a secret that will seal their fate. For each has been marked for murder.

Andrew Carnegie,David Nasaw,/books/andrew-carnegie-david-nasaw,"A New York Times bestseller!The definitive account of the life of Andrew Carnegie Celebrated historian David Nasaw, whom The New York Times Book Review has called ""a meticulous researcher and a cool analyst,"" brings new life to the story of one of America's most famous and successful businessmen and philanthropistsâin what will prove to be the biography of the season.Born of modest origins in Scotland in 1835, Andrew Carnegie is best known as the founder of Carnegie Steel. His rags to riches story has never been told as dramatically and vividly as in Nasaw's new biography. Carnegie, the son of an impoverished linen weaver, moved to Pittsburgh at the age of thirteen. The embodiment of the American dream, he pulled himself up from bobbin boy in a cotton factory to become the richest man in the world. He spent the rest of his life giving away the fortune he had accumulated and crusading for international peace. For all that he accomplished and came to represent to the American publicâa wildly successful businessman and capitalist, a self-educated writer, peace activist, philanthropist, man of letters, lover of culture, and unabashed enthusiast for American democracy and capitalismâCarnegie has remained, to this day, an enigma.Nasaw explains how Carnegie made his early fortune and what prompted him to give it all away, how he was drawn into the campaign first against American involvement in the Spanish-American War and then for international peace, and how he used his friendships with presidents and prime ministers to try to pull the world back from the brink of disaster. With a trove of new materialâunpublished chapters of Carnegie's Autobiography; personal letters between Carnegie and his future wife, Louise, and other family members; his prenuptial agreement; diaries of family and close friends; his applications for citizenship; his extensive correspondence with Henry Clay Frick; and dozens of private letters to and from presidents Grant, Cleveland, McKinley, Roosevelt, and British prime ministers Gladstone and Balfour, as well as friends Herbert Spencer, Matthew Arnold, and Mark TwainâNasaw brilliantly plumbs the core of this facinating and complex man, deftly placing his life in cultural and political context as only a master storyteller can.","['non-fiction', 'biographies & memoirs', 'business & management', 'history']",3,2023-12-22 00:00:00
Andrew Wyeth,Audrey M.

While previous publications have mainly analyzed Wyethâs work thematically, this publication places him fully in the context of the long 20th century, tracing his creative development from World War I through the new millennium.Published to coincide with the centenary of Wyethâs birth, the book looks at four major chronological periods in the artistâs career: Wyeth as a product of the interwar years, when he started to form his own âwar memoriesâ through military props and documentary photography he discovered in his fatherâs art studio; the change from his âtheatricalâ pictures of the 1940s to his own visceral responses to the landscape around Chadds Ford, Pennsylvania, and his familyâs home in Maine; his sudden turn, in 1968, into the realm of erotic art, including a completely new assessment of Wyethâs âHelga picturesââa series of secret, nude depictions of his neighbor Helga Testorfâwithin his career as a whole; and his late, self-reflective works, which includes the discussion of his previously unknown painting entitled Goodbye, now believed to be Wyethâs last work.","['non-fiction', 'biographies & memoirs', 'arts & entertainment']",1,2020-05-14 00:00:00

Many, if not most, of the worldâs largest companies were originally funded by angelsâcompanies like Apple, Microsoft, LinkedIn and Amazon.com.But until now, little has been written about these angels, due in part to their preference for anonymity. ANGEL INVESTING: The Gust Guide to Making Money and Having Fun Investing in Startups by David S.

Every year angels invest over $20 billion into startup companies in the US alone (and double that amount worldwide). Historically this been a virtually random activity, but over the past several years angel investing has begun to be recognized as a legitimate part of the Alternative Investments asset class.With a foreword by Reid Hoffmanâco-founder of LinkedIn and a prolific angel investor himselfâtogether with hard research studies and a host of stories from his personal experience as one of the worldâs leading angels, Rose explains in this book precisely how angels and venture capitalists differ, describes proven ways for entrepreneurs to attract them, and provides all the relevant resources for investors to enter into the world of startup funding.","['non-fiction', 'business & management', 'money & investing']",1,2023-12-22 00:00:00

Anthropic Bias,Nick Bostrom,/books/anthropic-bias,"Anthropic Bias explores how to reason when you suspect that your evidence is biased by ""observation selection effects""--that is, evidence that has been filtered by the precondition that there be some suitably positioned observer to ""have"" the evidence. This conundrum--sometimes alluded to as ""the anthropic principle,"" ""self-locating belief,"" or ""indexical information""--turns out to be a surprisingly perplexing and intellectually stimulating challenge, one abounding with important implications for many areas in science and philosophy.There are the philosophical thought experiments and paradoxes: the Doomsday Argument; Sleeping Beauty; the Presumptuous Philosopher; Adam & Eve; the Absent-Minded Driver; the Shooting Room.And there are the applications in contemporary science: cosmology (""How many universes are there?"", ""Why does the universe appear fine-tuned for life?""); evolutionary theory (""How improbable was the evolution of intelligent life on our planet?""); the problem of time's arrow (""Can it be given a thermodynamic explanation?""); quantum physics (""How can the many-worlds theory be tested?""); game-theory problems with imperfect recall (""How to model them?""); even traffic analysis (""Why is the 'next lane' faster?"").Anthropic Bias argues that the same principles are at work across all these domains. And it offers a synthesis: a mathematically explicit theory of observation selection effects that attempts to meet scientific needs while steering clear of philosophical paradox.","['non-fiction', 'philosophy', 'science & nature']",1,2023-12-22 00:00:00
Anti-Fascism,Paul Gottfried,/books/anti-fascism,"An antifascist movement perspective from the right.Antifascism contends that the Left, which claims to be opposed to fascism, shares little with any prior Left, with the exception of minor commonality with Frankfurt School critical thinkers, and that modern antifascists are not fighting against a resurgence of interwar fascism. Paul Gottfried examines antifascism from its early 20th-century European origins through its contemporary American form. He contends that the transformation of the Marxist Left into an intersectional one has been a key milestone in defining the current political spectrum. This new Left, which has emerged as the dominant force throughout the Western world, has become the focal point of political and ideological conflicts.Gottfried discusses nationalism versus globalism, the antifascism of the American conservative establishment, and Antifa in the United States. He also touches on the significant changes that antifascist ideology has undergone since the 1960s as well as fascist and antifascist models of the state and assumptions about human nature. An introduction to Thomas Hobbes' notion of knowledge from Leviathan is also offered.Gottfried reaches the conclusion in Antifascism that fostering a fear of fascism now serves the interests of the powerful, particularly those in positions of political, journalistic, and educational power who aim to intimidate and isolate their opponents. He highlights how multinational capitalists have generously supported the intersectional Left and looks at how the white working class in Europe, including former members of Communist parties, is moving toward the populist Right, arguing that this demonstrates a political dynamic that is distinct from the more traditional dialectic between Marxists and anti-Marxists.","['history', 'economics & politics', 'non-fiction']",1,2023-11-21 00:00:00

Extremely ambitious and multidisciplinary, Antifragile provides a blueprint for how to behave-and thrive-in a world we don't understand and which is too uncertain for us to even try to understand. He who is not antifragile will perish. Why is the city state better than the nation state, why is debt bad for you, and why is almost everything modern bound to fail? The book covers innovation, health, biology, medicine, life decisions, politics, foreign policy, urban planning, war, personal finance, and economic systems. Throughout, the voice and recipes of the ancient wisdom from Phoenician, Roman, Greek, and Medieval sources are heard loud and clear.","['non-fiction', 'economics & politics', 'science & nature', 'business & management', 'psychology']",20,2023-12-22 00:00:00
Antisocial,Andrew Marantz,/books/antisocial,"From a rising star at The New Yorker , a deeply immersive chronicle of how the optimistic entrepreneurs of Silicon Valley set out to create a free and democratic internetâand how the cynical propagandists of the alt-right exploited that freedom to propel the extreme into the mainstream.For several years, Andrew Marantz, a New Yorker staff writer, has been embedded in two worlds. The first is the world of social-media entrepreneurs, who, acting out of naÃ¯vete and reckless ambition, upended all traditional means of receiving and transmitting information. The second is the world of the people he calls ""the gate crashers""âthe conspiracists, white supremacists, and nihilist trolls who have become experts at using social media to advance their corrosive agenda. Antisocial ranges broadlyâfrom the first mass-printed books to the trending hashtags of the present; from secret gatherings of neo-Fascists to the White House press briefing roomâand traces how the unthinkable becomes thinkable, and then how it becomes reality. Combining the keen narrative detail of Bill Buford's Among the Thugs and the sweep of George Packer's The Unwinding, Antisocial reveals how the boundaries between technology, media, and politics have been erased, resulting in a deeply broken informational landscapeâthe landscape in which we all now live.Marantz shows how alienated young people are led down the rabbit hole of online radicalization, and how fringe ideas spreadâfrom anonymous corners of social media to cable TV to the President's Twitter feed. Marantz also sits with the creators of social media as they start to reckon with the forces they've unleashed. Will they be able to solve the communication crisis they helped bring about, or are their interventions too little too late?","['non-fiction', 'economics & politics', 'technology']",1,2023-12-22 00:00:00
Any Human Heart,William Boyd,/books/any-human-heart,"Logan Gonzago Mountstuart, writer, was born in 1906, and died of a heart attack on October 5, 1991, aged 85. William Boyd's novel Any Human Heart is his disjointed autobiography, a massive tome chronicling ""my personal rollercoaster""--or rather, ""not so much a rollercoaster"", but a yo-yo, ""a jerking spinning toy in the hands of a maladroit child."" From his early childhood in Montevideo, son of an English corned beef executive and his Uraguayan secretary, through his years at a Norfolk public school and Oxford, Mountstuart traces his haphazard development as a writer. Early and easy success is succeeded by a long half-century of mediocrity, disappointments and setbacks, both personal and professional, leading him to multiple failed marriages, internment, alcoholism, and abject poverty.Mountstuart's sorry tale is also the story of a British way of life in inexorable decline, as his journey takes in the Bloomsbury set, the General Strike, the Spanish Civil War, 1930s Americans in Paris, wartime espionage, New York avant garde art, even the Baader-Meinhof gang--all with a stellar supporting cast. The most sustained and best moment comes mid-book, as Mountstuart gets caught up in one of Britain's murkier wartime secrets, in the company of the here truly despicable Duke and Duchess of Windsor. Elsewhere Boyd occasionally misplaces his tongue too obviously in his cheek--the Wall Street Crash is trailed with truly crashing inelegance--but overall Any Human Heart is a witty, inventive and ultimately moving novel. Boyd succeeds in conjuring not only a compelling 20th century but also, in the hapless Logan Mountstuart, an anti-hero who achieves something approaching passive greatness.",['fiction'],1,2020-10-24 00:00:00

Or when a weapon that can hunt its own targets is hacked? Although it sounds like science fiction, the technology already exists to create weapons that can attack targets without human input. Paul Scharre, a leading expert in emerging weapons technologies, draws on deep research and firsthand experience to explore how these next-generation weapons are changing warfare.Scharreâs far-ranging investigation examines the emergence of autonomous weapons, the movement to ban them, and the legal and ethical issues surrounding their use. He spotlights artificial intelligence in military technology, spanning decades of innovation from German noise-seeking Wren torpedoes in World War IIâantecedents of todayâs homing missilesâto autonomous cyber weapons, submarine-hunting robot ships, and robot tank armies. Through interviews with defense experts, ethicists, psychologists, and activists, Scharre surveys what challenges might face ""centaur warfighters"" on future battlefields, which will combine human and machine cognition. Weâve made tremendous technological progress in the past few decades, but we have also glimpsed the terrifying mishaps that can result from complex automated systemsâsuch as when advanced F-22 fighter jets experienced a computer meltdown the first time they flew over the International Date Line.At least thirty countries already have defensive autonomous weapons that operate under human supervision. Around the globe, militaries are racing to build robotic weapons with increasing autonomy. The ethical questions within this book grow more pressing each day. To what extent should such technologies be advanced? And if responsible democracies ban them, would that stop rogue regimes from taking advantage? At the forefront of a game-changing debate, Army of None engages military history, global policy, and cutting-edge science to argue that we must embrace technology where it can make war more precise and humane, but without surrendering human judgment. When the choice is life or death, there is no replacement for the human heart.","['non-fiction', 'science & nature', 'economics & politics', 'technology']",1,2023-12-22 00:00:00

He became the first African American to play for the US Davis Cup team in 1963, and two years later he won the NCAA singles championship. In 1968, he rose to a number one national ranking.

In the 1970s and 1980s, Ashe gained renown as an advocate for sportsmanship, education, racial equality, and the elimination of apartheid in South Africa. But from 1979 on, he was forced to deal with a serious heart condition that led to multiple surgeries and blood transfusions, one of which left him HIV-positive. After devoting the last ten months of his life to AIDS activism, Ashe died in February 1993 at the age of forty-nine, leaving an inspiring legacy of dignity, integrity, and active citizenship.Based on prodigious research, including more than one hundred interviews, Arthur Ashe puts Ashe in the context of both his time and the long struggle of African-American athletes seeking equal opportunity and respect, and âwill serve as the standard work on Ashe for some timeâ (Library Journal, starred review).","['non-fiction', 'biographies & memoirs', 'health & fitness']",1,2023-12-22 00:00:00
As A Man Thinketh,James Allen,/books/as-a-man-thinketh,"As a Man Thinketh was first published in 1903. In it, Allen describes how man is the creator and shaper of his destiny by the thoughts which he thinks. Â We rise and fall in exact accordance with the character of the thoughts which we entertain. Â Our environment is the result of the thoughts that we harbor and the behavior that our thoughts bring about.Part of the New Thought Movement, Allen reveals the secrets to having the most fulfilling existence possible, guided by a proper understanding and appreciate of how thought shapes our lives. Â Allen advises on how to better manage our thoughts and how to direct them into more constructive behavior. Â Though written more than one hundred years ago, the language and resonance of this classic still hold up today, inviting each of us to reflect not on the world and others, but our own thoughts and how to regain their possession.

In more than a century, As A Man Thinketh has become an inspirational classic, selling millions of copies worldwide and bringing faith, inspiration, and self- healing to all who have encountered it.","['non-fiction', 'philosophy', 'self improvement', 'psychology']",4,2023-12-22 00:00:00

Assata,Assata Shakur,/books/assata,"On May 2, 1973, Black Panther Assata Shakur (aka JoAnne Chesimard) lay in a hospital, close to death, handcuffed to her bed, while local, state, and federal police attempted to question her about the shootout on the New Jersey Turnpike that had claimed the life of a white state trooper. Long a target of J. Edgar Hoover's campaign to defame, infiltrate, and criminalize Black nationalist organizations and their leaders, Shakur was incarcerated for four years prior to her conviction on flimsy evidence in 1977 as an accomplice to murder.This intensely personal and political autobiography belies the fearsome image of JoAnne Chesimard long projected by the media and the state. With wit and candor, Assata Shakur recounts the experiences that led her to a life of activism and portrays the strengths, weaknesses, and eventual demise of Black and White revolutionary groups at the hand of government officials. The result is a signal contribution to the literature about growing up Black in America that has already taken its place alongside The Autobiography of Malcolm X and the works of Maya Angelou.Two years after her conviction, Assata Shakur escaped from prison. She was given political asylum by Cuba, where she now resides.","['non-fiction', 'biographies & memoirs', 'history', 'economics & politics']",2,2020-10-24 00:00:00
Assembling Life,David Deamer,/books/assembling-life,"In Assembling Life, David Deamer tackles some of the most pressing topics in the field of life origins research. How did non-living organic molecules come together to generate the first forms of primitive cellular life, for example? What was the source of those substances and the energy that allowed the first nucleic acids to be formed? Is it more likely that life began in the ocean or in fresh water on land? Is it possible that life began on Mars?The book gives an outline of the early Earth's circumstances four billion years ago and explains why fresh water hot springs are a viable alternative to salty saltwater as a possible place for life to begin. Deamer discusses his research into organic chemicals that may have been present in the primordial environment, as well as the volcanic circumstances that might drive chemical development toward the birth of life. The book is not just focused on Earth, but also analyses if life may have originated elsewhere in our solar system. Deamer does not speculate on how life began because we can never know for sure. Instead, he wants to know how life can start on every habitable planet, with Earth being the only known example thus far.","['non-fiction', 'science & nature', 'history']",1,2023-12-22 00:00:00

Astounding,Alec Nevala-Lee,/books/astounding,"Astounding is the landmark account of the extraordinary partnership between four controversial writersâJohn W. Campbell, Isaac Asimov, Robert A. Heinlein, and L. Ron Hubbardâwho set off a revolution in science fiction and forever changed our world. This remarkable cultural narrative centers on the figure of John W. Campbell, Jr., whom Asimov called âthe most powerful force in science fiction ever.â Campbell, who has never been the subject of a biography until now, was both a visionary authorâhe wrote the story that was later filmed as The Thingâand the editor of the groundbreaking magazine best known as Astounding Science Fiction, in which he discovered countless legendary writers and published classic works ranging from the I, Robot series to Dune. Over a period of more than thirty years, from the rise of the pulps to the debut of Star Trek, he dominated the genre, and his three closest collaborators reached unimaginable heights. Asimov became the most prolific author in American history; Heinlein emerged as the leading science fiction writer of his generation with the novels Starship Troopers and Stranger in a Strange Land; and Hubbard achieved lasting fameâand infamyâas the founder of the Church of Scientology.Drawing on unexplored archives, thousands of unpublished letters, and dozens of interviews, Alec Nevala-Lee offers a riveting portrait of this circle of authors, their work, and their tumultuous private lives. With unprecedented scope, drama, and detail, Astounding describes how fan culture was born in the depths of the Great Depression; follows these four friends and rivals through World War II and the dawn of the atomic era; and honors such exceptional women as DoÃ±a Campbell and Leslyn Heinlein, whose pivotal roles in the history of the genre have gone largely unacknowledged. For the first time, it reveals the startling extent of Campbellâs influence on the ideas that evolved into Scientology, which prompted Asimov to observe: âI knew Campbell and I knew Hubbard, and no movement can have two Messiahs.â It looks unsparingly at the tragic final act that estranged the others from Campbell, bringing the golden age of science fiction to a close, and it illuminates how their complicated legacy continues to shape the imaginations of millions and our vision of the future itself.","['non-fiction', 'history', 'biographies & memoirs']",1,2023-12-22 00:00:00

The first section, âFolly,â tells the story of Alice, a young American editor, and her relationship with the famous and much older writer Ezra Blazer. A tender and exquisite account of an unexpected romance that takes place in New York during the early years of the Iraq War, âFollyâ also suggests an aspiring novelistâs coming-of-age. By contrast, âMadnessâ is narrated by Amar, an Iraqi-American man who, on his way to visit his brother in Kurdistan, is detained by immigration officers and spends the last weekend of 2008 in a holding room in Heathrow. These two seemingly disparate stories gain resonance as their perspectives interact and overlap, with yet new implications for their relationship revealed in an unexpected coda.A stunning debut from a rising literary star, Asymmetry is âa transgressive roman a clef, a novel of ideas, and a politically engaged work of metafictionâ (The New York Times Book Review), and a âmasterpieceâ in the original sense of the wordâ (The Atlantic).

Average Is Over,Tyler Cowen,/books/average-is-over,"Widely acclaimed as one of the worldâs most influential economists, Tyler Cowen returns with his groundbreaking follow-up to the New York Times bestseller The Great Stagnation.The widening gap between rich and poor means dealing with one big, uncomfortable truth: If youâre not at the top, youâre at the bottom.The global labor market is changing radically thanks to growth at the high endâand the low. About three quarters of the jobs created in the United States since the great recession pay only a bit more than minimum wage. Still, the United States has more millionaires and billionaires than any country ever, and we continue to mint them.In this eye-opening book, renowned economist and bestselling author Tyler Cowen explains that phenomenon: High earners are taking ever more advantage of machine intelligence in data analysis and achieving ever-better results. Meanwhile, low earners who havenât committed to learning, to making the most of new technologies, have poor prospects. Nearly every business sector relies less and less on manual labor, and this fact is forever changing the world of work and wages. A steady, secure life somewhere in the middleâaverageâis over.With The Great Stagnation, Cowen explained why median wages stagnated over the last four decades; in Average Is Over he reveals the essential nature of the new economy, identifies the best path forward for workers and entrepreneurs, and provides readers with actionable advice to make the most of the new economic landscape. It is a challenging and sober must-read but ultimately exciting, good news. In debates about our nationâs economic future, it will be impossible to ignore.","['non-fiction', 'economics & politics', 'business & management', 'science & nature', 'technology']",2,2023-12-22 00:00:00
Avid Reader,Robert Gottlieb,/books/avid-reader,"After editing The Columbia Review, staging plays at Cambridge, and a stint in the greeting-card department of Macy's, Robert Gottlieb stumbled into a job at Simon and Schuster.

Back from the Dead,Bill Walton,/books/back-from-the-dead,"Bill Walton's inspirational biography recalls his catastrophic injuries and miraculous recoveries, set against the backdrop of his UCLA victories under John Wooden, his renowned NBA career, and his love of music and the Grateful Dead.Bill Walton experienced a devastating spinal collapse in February 2008, rendering him unable to move. This was the culmination of a lifetime of injuries. He spent three years eating his meals on the floor of his residence and crawling to the bathroom, where he could barely get up onto the toilet. Walton was put to the test by the intense agony and lengthy recuperation. He healed, thanks to tremendous patience, courage, drive, and sacrificeâas well as groundbreaking surgeryâand now recounts his life experience in this astonishing and one-of-a-kind biography.Walton was strongly inspired by the political and cultural revolutions of the 1950s and 1960s as he grew up in San Diego. Outside of his family, his greatest role model outside of music and politics was super-straight UCLA basketball coach John Wooden, a serious, disciplined mentor who seemed impervious to the tumult of the times. Despite their constant tension and strife, the two men spoke almost every day for forty-three years, until Wooden's death at the age of ninety-nine.Walton selected a career in broadcasting when his playing days ended, despite a lifelong stuttering problem. He went on to win an Emmy Award and other awards for broadcasting, and he became a well-known media commentator.No brilliance, according to John Wooden, has ever come without a cost. The true tale of Walton's life exemplifies this adage perfectly. Back from the Dead tells his remarkable narrative in his own words, including his basketball and broadcasting careers, as well as his numerous losses and comebacks, and his ultimate triumph as the hardest of champions.","['non-fiction', 'health & fitness', 'biographies & memoirs']",1,2023-12-22 00:00:00

We like to imagine that doctors are impartially educated, when in reality much of their education is funded by the pharmaceutical industry.

Banker to the Poor,Muhammad Yunus,/books/banker-to-the-poor,"Muhammad Yunus is that rare thing: a bona fide visionary. His dream is the total eradication of poverty from the world. In 1983, against the advice of banking and government officials, Yunus established Grameen, a bank devoted to providing the poorest of Bangladesh with minuscule loans. Grameen Bank, based on the belief that credit is a basic human right, not the privilege of a fortunate few, now provides over 2.5 billion dollars of micro-loans to more than two million families in rural Bangladesh. Ninety-four percent of Yunus's clients are women, and repayment rates are near 100 percent. Around the world, micro-lending programs inspired by Grameen are blossoming, with more than three hundred programs established in the United States alone.âBanker to the Poor is Muhammad Yunus's memoir of how he decided to change his life in order to help the world's poor. In it he traces the intellectual and spiritual journey that led him to fundamentally rethink the economic relationship between rich and poor, and the challenges he and his colleagues faced in founding Grameen. He also provides wise, hopeful guidance for anyone who would like to join him in ""putting homelessness and destitution in a museum so that one day our children will visit it and ask how we could have allowed such a terrible thing to go on for so long."" The definitive history of micro-credit direct from the man that conceived of it, Banker to the Poor is necessary and inspirational reading for anyone interested in economics, public policy, philanthropy, social history, and business.Muhammad Yunus was born in Bangladesh and earned his Ph.D. in economics in the United States at Vanderbilt University, where he was deeply influenced by the civil rights movement. He still lives in Bangladesh, and travels widely around the world on behalf of Grameen Bank and the concept of micro-credit.","['non-fiction', 'economics & politics', 'business & management']",2,2023-12-22 00:00:00
Barbarian Days,William Finnegan,/books/barbarian-days,"Winner of the 2016 Pulitzer Prize for AutobiographyBarbarian Days is William Finneganâs memoir of an obsession, a complex enchantment. Surfing only looks like a sport. To initiates, it is something else: a beautiful addiction, a demanding course of study, a morally dangerous pastime, a way of life. Raised in California and Hawaii, Finnegan started surfing as a child. He has chased waves all over the world, wandering for years through the South Pacific, Australia, Asia, Africa. A bookish boy, and then an excessively adventurous young man, he went on to become a distinguished writer and war reporter.

It immerses the reader in the edgy camaraderie of close male friendships forged in challenging waves.Finnegan shares stories of life in a whites-only gang in a tough school in Honolulu. He shows us a world turned upside down for kids and adults alike by the social upheavals of the 1960s. He details the intricacies of famous waves and his own apprenticeships to them. Youthful follyâhe drops LSD while riding huge Honolua Bay, on Mauiâis served up with rueful humor. As Finneganâs travels take him ever farther afield, he discovers the picturesque simplicity of a Samoan fishing village, dissects the sexual politics of Tongan interactions with Americans and Japanese, and navigates the Indonesian black market while nearly succumbing to malaria. Throughout, he surfs, carrying readers with him on rides of harrowing, unprecedented lucidity.Barbarian Days is an old-school adventure story, an intellectual autobiography, a social history, a literary road movie, and an extraordinary exploration of the gradual mastering of an exacting, little-understood art.","['non-fiction', 'biographies & memoirs', 'health & fitness']",2,2023-12-22 00:00:00

Philanthropist, investor, and technology pioneer Jean Case brings to life the five Be Fearless principles common to the people and organizations that bring about transformational change.When National Geographic Chairman Jean Case set out to investigate the core qualities of great change makers, past and present, from inventors to revolutionaries, she found five surprising traits they all had in common.

He published books, drove a Mercedes and regularly vacationed in the Caribbean. By most societal standards, he had achieved great success... And yet he couldnât escape the feeling that something was missing.Psilocybin and LSD changed that. During a period of experimentation, Alpert peeled away each layer of his identity, disassociating from himself as a professor, a social cosmopolite, and lastly, as a physical being. Fear turned into exaltation upon the realization that at his truest, he was just his inner-self: a luminous being that he could trust indefinitely and love infinitely.And thus, a spiritual journey commenced. Alpert headed to India where his guru renamed him Baba Ram Dass â âservant of God.â He was introduced to mindful breathing exercises, hatha yoga, and Eastern philosophy. If he found himself reminiscing or planning, he was reminded to âBe Here Now.â He started upon the path of enlightenment, and has been journeying along it ever since.Be Here Now is a vehicle for sharing the true message, and a guide to self-determination.","['non-fiction', 'spirituality & religion', 'biographies & memoirs', 'science & nature', 'philosophy', 'psychology']",4,2023-12-22 00:00:00

Behave,Robert M. Sapolsky,/books/behave,"Why do we do the things we do?More than a decade in the making, this game-changing book is Robert Sapolsky's genre-shattering attempt to answer that question as fully as perhaps only he could, looking at it from every angle. Sapolsky's storytelling concept is delightful but it also has a powerful intrinsic logic: he starts by looking at the factors that bear on a person's reaction in the precise moment a behavior occurs, and then hops back in time from there, in stages, ultimately ending up at the deep history of our species and its evolutionary legacy.And so the first category of explanation is the neurobiological one. A behavior occurs--whether an example of humans at our best, worst, or somewhere in between. What went on in a person's brain a second before the behavior happened? Then Sapolsky pulls out to a slightly larger field of vision, a little earlier in time: What sight, sound, or smell caused the nervous system to produce that behavior? And then, what hormones acted hours to days earlier to change how responsive that individual is to the stimuli that triggered the nervous system? By now he has increased our field of vision so that we are thinking about neurobiology and the sensory world of our environment and endocrinology in trying to explain what happened.Sapolsky keeps going: How was that behavior influenced by structural changes in the nervous system over the preceding months, by that person's adolescence, childhood, fetal life, and then back to his or her genetic makeup? Finally, he expands the view to encompass factors larger than one individual. How did culture shape that individual's group, what ecological factors millennia old formed that culture? And on and on, back to evolutionary factors millions of years old.The result is one of the most dazzling tours d'horizon of the science of human behavior ever attempted, a majestic synthesis that harvests cutting-edge research across a range of disciplines to provide a subtle and nuanced perspective on why we ultimately do the things we do...for good and for ill. Sapolsky builds on this understanding to wrestle with some of our deepest and thorniest questions relating to tribalism and xenophobia, hierarchy and competition, morality and free will, and war and peace. Wise, humane, often very funny, Behave is a towering achievement, powerfully humanizing, and downright heroic in its own right.","['non-fiction', 'science & nature', 'psychology']",7,2023-12-22 00:00:00

Being Nixon,Evan Thomas,/books/being-nixon,"The definitive New York Times bestselling biography of Richard M. Nixon, a political genius whose glaring personal faults would force him from office and forever poison his reputation.Evan Thomas paints a bold and distinctive portrayal of America's 37th president, Richard Nixon, in this revelatory biography. Nixon was a paradoxical man who was both determinedly hopeful and tragically damaged. Nixon was regarded as a liberal in some quarters for his efforts to desegregate Southern schools, create the Environmental Protection Agency, and end the draught. He was one of the primary architects of the modern Republican Party and its ""silent majority"" of disaffected whites and conservative ex-Dixiecrats.Richard Nixon, the son of devout Quakers, grew up in the shadow of an older, favored brother and thrived on conflict and resistance, much like his competitor John F. Kennedy. Nixon was continually waging crusades and battling against real and imagined adversaries throughout high school, college, the navy, and politics. Nixon's darker half devised schemes to bring down his political foes, earning him the infamous nickname ""Tricky Dick."" He had the plainspoken eloquence to move American television audiences to tears with his career-saving ""Checkers"" speech; meanwhile, Nixon's darker half devised schemes to bring down his political foes, earning him the notorious nickname ""Tricky Dick."" Thomas' biography, which draws on a variety of historical accounts, reveals the contradictions of a leader whose vision and foresight led to dÃ©tente with the Soviet Union and the restoration of relations with communist China, but whose underhanded political tactics tainted his reputation long before the Watergate scandal.Being Nixon is a fascinating look at a man capable of enormous courage and amazing deceptionâa balanced depiction of a president too frequently reduced to caricatureâa highly incisive character analysis as well as a superb political history.","['non-fiction', 'biographies & memoirs', 'economics & politics', 'history']",1,2023-12-22 00:00:00

Believer,David Axelrod,/books/believer,"David Axelrod has always been a believer. Whether as a young journalist investigating city corruption, a campaign consultant guiding underdog candidates against entrenched orthodoxy, or as senior adviser to the president during one of the worst crises in American history, Axelrod held fast to his faith in the power of stories to unite diverse communities and ignite transformative political change. Now this legendary strategist, the mastermind behind Barack Obamaâs historic election campaigns, shares a wealth of stories from his forty-year journey through the inner workings of American democracy. Believer is the tale of a political life well lived, of a man who never gave up on the deepest promises our country has to offer.The heart of Believer is Axelrodâs twenty-year friendship with Barack Obama, a warm partnership that inspired both men even as it propelled each to great heights. Taking a chance on an unlikely candidate for the U.S. Senate, Axelrod ultimately collaborated closely Obama on his political campaigns, and served as the invaluable strategist who contributed to the tremendous victories in 2008 and 2012. Switching careers again, Axelrod served as senior adviser to the president during one of the most challenging periods in national history: working at Obamaâs side as he battled an economic disaster; navigated America through two wars; and fought to reform health care, the financial sector, and our gridlocked political institutions. In Believer, Axelrod offers a deeper and richer profile of this extraordinary figureâwho in just four years vaulted from the Illinois State Senate to the Oval Officeâfrom the perspective of one who was at his side every step of the way.Spanning forty years that include corruption and transformation, turmoil and progress, Believer takes readers behind the closed doors of politics even as it offers a thrilling call to democratic action. Axelrodâs Believer is a powerful and inspiring memoir enlivened by the charm and candor of one of the greatest political strategists in recent American history.","['non-fiction', 'economics & politics', 'biographies & memoirs', 'history']",1,2023-12-22 00:00:00

Better,Atul Gawande,/books/better,"The struggle to perform well is universal: each one of us faces fatigue, limited resources, and imperfect abilities in whatever we do. But nowhere is this drive to do better more important than in medicine, where lives are on the line with every decision. In his new book, Atul Gawande explores how doctors strive to close the gap between best intentions and best performance in the face of obstacles that sometimes seem insurmountable. Gawande's gripping stories of diligence, ingenuity, and what it means to do right by people take us to battlefield surgical tents in Iraq, to labor and delivery rooms in Boston, to a polio outbreak in India, and to malpractice courtrooms around the country. He discusses the ethical dilemmas of doctors participation in lethal injections, examines the influence of money on modern medicine, and recounts the astoundingly contentious history of hand washing.And as in all his writing, Gawande gives us an inside look at his own life as a practicing surgeon, offering a searingly honest firsthand account of work in a field where mistakes are both unavoidable and unthinkable. At once unflinching and compassionate, Better is an exhilarating journey narrated by arguably the best nonfiction doctor-writer around (Salon).

Beyond Choice,Alexander Sanger,/books/beyond-choice,"Thirty years after Roe v. Wade, the argument between ""pro-choicers"" and ""pro-lifers"" has reached stalemate. Pro-choice arguments haven't persuaded a comfortable majority that legal abortion is vital to our society, nor addressed our moral qualms. Younger people are less and less supportive of reproductive rights. Since 1996, state legislatures have enacted nearly 300 pieces of anti-choice legislation. With Roe in jeopardy, International Planned Parenthood Council Chair Alexander Sanger asks a simple but heretical question: How many more pieces of anti-choice legislation will it take to get the pro-choice movement to rethink its approach to the issue?In Beyond Choice Sanger explores the history of the reproductive rights movement to discover how it got stuck in its thinking, and then provides a convincing new argument for the moral rightness of its cause. He shows why it is vital to the health and survival of the human race that couples be able to have children, or not, when they choose; why reproductive rights are just as important to men as to women; and why, in an era of new reproductive technologies, completely unfettered choice is not morally defensible.âBeyond Choice is inspiring and important reading for women's rights advocates, opinion leaders, medical ethicists, and anyone concerned to preserve our freedom to reproduce, or not, without government intervention.",['non-fiction'],0,2022-06-26 00:00:00

Beyond Ideology,Frances E. Lee,/books/beyond-ideology,"The congressional agenda, Frances Lee contends, includes many issues about which liberals and conservatives generally agree. Even over these matters, though, Democratic and Republican senators tend to fight with each other. What explains this discord? Beyond Ideology argues that many partisan battles are rooted in competition for power rather than disagreement over the rightful role of government.The first book to systematically distinguish Senate disputes centering on ideological questions from the large proportion of them that do not, this volume foregrounds the role of power struggle in partisan conflict. Presidential leadership, for example, inherently polarizes legislators who can influence public opinion of the president and his party by how they handle his agenda. Senators also exploit good government measures and floor debate to embarrass opponents and burnish their own partyâs imageâeven when the issues involved are broadly supported or low-stakes. Moreover, Lee contends, the congressional agenda itself amplifies conflict by increasingly focusing on issues that reliably differentiate the parties. With the new president pledging to stem the tide of partisan polarization, Beyond Ideology provides a timely taxonomy of exactly what stands in his way.","['non-fiction', 'economics & politics']",1,2023-12-22 00:00:00

Beyond Smoke and Mirrors,Douglas S. Massey,/books/beyond-smoke-and-mirrors,"Migration between Mexico and the United States is part of a historical process of increasing North American integration. This process acquired new momentum with the passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement in 1994, which lowered barriers to the movement of goods, capital, services, and information. But rather than include labor in this new regime, the United States continues to resist the integration of the labor markets of the two countries. Instead of easing restrictions on Mexican labor, the United States has militarized its border and adopted restrictive new policies of immigrant disenfranchisement. Beyond Smoke and Mirrors examines the devastating impact of these immigration policies on the social and economic fabric of the Mexico and the United States, and calls for a sweeping reform of the current system.âBeyond Smoke and Mirrors shows how U.S. immigration policies enacted between 1986â1996âlargely for symbolic domestic political purposesâharm the interests of Mexico, the United States, and the people who migrate between them. The costs have been high. The book documents how the massive expansion of border enforcement has wasted billions of dollars and hundreds of lives, yet has not deterred increasing numbers of undocumented immigrants from heading north. The authors also show how the new policies unleashed a host of unintended consequences: a shift away from seasonal, circular migration toward permanent settlement; the creation of a black market for Mexican labor; the transformation of Mexican immigration from a regional phenomenon into a broad social movement touching every region of the country; and even the lowering of wages for legal U.S. residents. What had been a relatively open and benign labor process before 1986 was transformed into an exploitative underground system of labor coercion, one that lowered wages and working conditions of undocumented migrants, legal immigrants, and American citizens alike.âBeyond Smoke and Mirrors offers specific proposals for repairing the damage. Rather than denying the reality of labor migration, the authors recommend regularizing it and working to manage it so as to promote economic development in Mexico, minimize costs and disruptions for the United States, and maximize benefits for all concerned. This book provides an essential ""user's manual"" for readers seeking a historical, theoretical, and substantive understanding of how U.S. policy on Mexican immigration evolved to its current dysfunctional state, as well as how it might be fixed.","['non-fiction', 'economics & politics', 'history']",1,2023-12-22 00:00:00

Beyond Words,Carl Safina,/books/beyond-words,"I wanted to know what they were experiencing, and why to us they feel so compelling, and so-close. This time I allowed myself to ask them the question that for a scientist was forbidden fruit: Who are you?Weaving decades of field observations with exciting new discoveries about the brain, Carl Safina's landmark book offers an intimate view of animal behavior to challenge the fixed boundary between humans and nonhuman animals. In Beyond Words, readers travel to Amboseli National Park in the threatened landscape of Kenya and witness struggling elephant families work out how to survive poaching and drought, then to Yellowstone National Park to observe wolves sort out the aftermath of one pack's personal tragedy, and finally plunge into the astonishingly peaceful society of killer whales living in the crystalline waters of the Pacific Northwest.Beyond Words brings forth powerful and illuminating insight into the unique personalities of animals through extraordinary stories of animal joy, grief, jealousy, anger, and love. The similarity between human and nonhuman consciousness, self-awareness, and empathy calls us to re-evaluate how we interact with animals. Wise, passionate, and eye-opening at every turn, Beyond Words is ultimately a graceful examination of humanity's place in the world.","['non-fiction', 'science & nature']",1,2023-12-22 00:00:00

Abdul, an enterprising teenager, sees âa fortune beyond countingâ in the recyclable garbage that richer people throw away.

Beyond the Crash,Gordon Brown,/books/beyond-the-crash,"Former British Prime Minister and Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown believes the international financial crisis can be reversed, but that the world's leaders must work together if we are to avoid a decade of lost jobs and low growth. Brown speaks both as someone who was in the room driving discussions that led to some crucial decisions, and as an expert renowned for his financial acumen. No one who had Brown's access has written about the crisis yet, and no one has written so convincingly about what the global community must do next in order to climb out of this abyss. As he sees it, the crisis was brought on not simply by technical failings, but by ethical failings too. He argues that markets need morals, and suggests that the only way to truly ensure that the world economy does not flounder again is to institute a banking constitution and a global growth plan.","['non-fiction', 'business & management', 'economics & politics']",1,2023-12-22 00:00:00

By pursuing success in isolation - pushing others away as we push ourselves too hard - we are not just limiting our potential, we are becoming more stressed and disconnected than ever.In his highly anticipated follow-up to The Happiness Advantage, Achor reveals a better approach. Drawing on his work in 50 countries, he shows that success and happiness are not competitive sports. Rather, they depend almost entirely on how well we connect with, relate to, and learn from each other.Just as happiness is contagious, every dimension of human potential - performance, intelligence, creativity, leadership ability and health - is influenced by those around us. So when we help others become better, we reach new levels of potential, as well. Rather than fighting over scraps of the pie, we can expand the pie instead.Small Potential is the limited success we can attain alone. BIG Potential is what we can achieve together. Here, Achor offers five strategies - the SEEDS of Big Potential--for lifting the ceiling on what we can achieve while returning happiness and meaning to our lives.The dramatic shifts in how we approach work today demand an equally dramatic shift in our approach to success. Big Potential offers a new path to thriving in the modern world.","['non-fiction', 'business & management', 'psychology', 'self improvement']",1,2020-10-24 00:00:00

Biography of the Dollar,Craig Karmin,/books/biography-of-the-dollar,"Will the sun set on the greatest currency in the history of the world?For decades the dollar has been the undisputed champ. Itâs not only the currency of America but much of the world as well, the fuel of global prosperity. As the superengine of the worldâs only superpower, itâs accepted everywhere. When an Asian company trades with South America, those transactions are done in dollars, the currency of international business.But for how much longer? Economists fear America is digging a hole with an economy based on massive borrowing and huge deficits that cloud the dollarâs future. Will the buck be eclipsed by the euro or even Chinaâs renminbi? Should Americans worry when the value of the mighty U.S. dollar sinks to par with the Canadian âloonieâ?Craig Karminâs in-depth âbiographyâ of the dollar explores these issues. It also examines the green-backâs history, allure, and unique role as a catalyst for globalization, and how the American buck became so almighty that $ became perhaps the most powerful symbol on earth.Biography of the Dollar explores every aspect of its subject: the power of the Federal Reserve, the inner sanctums of foreign central banks that stockpile the currency, and the little-known circles of foreign exchange traders that determine a currencyâs worth. It traces the dollarâs ascendancy, including one incredibly important duck-hunting trip and the world-changing Bretton Woods Conference.With its watermark, color-shifting inks, and a presidential portrait that glows under ultraviolet light, the dollar has obsessed foreign governments, some of which have tried to counterfeit it. Even Saddam Hussein, who insisted on being paid in euros for oil, had $750,000 in hundred-dollar bills when captured. Yet if a worldwide currency has enabled a global economy to flourish, itâs also allowed the United States to owe unbelievable, shocking amounts of moneyâpaying hundreds of millions of dollars every single day just in interest on foreign debt; thatâs raised concerns that the dollar standard may not be sustainable.Any threat to the dollarâs privileged status would do much more than hurt American pride. It would mean U.S. companies and citizens would not be able to borrow at the low rates they have become accustomed to. The dollarâs demise would impact the rest of the world, too, boosting the costs of trade and investment if no other currency was able to play the same crucial role. Ultimately the dollar system may weaken, but it should endureâa while longer, at least; itâs in few peopleâs interest to see it fail, and there is still no credible alternative.Biography of the Dollar is must reading for anyone who wants to understand what truly makes the world go âroundâand whether it will continue to spin the way we want it to.","['non-fiction', 'business & management', 'economics & politics', 'money & investing']",1,2023-12-22 00:00:00

Black Box Thinking,Matthew Syed,/books/black-box-thinking,"Nobody wants to fail. But in highly complex organizations, success can happen only when we confront our mistakes, learn from our own version of a black box, and create a climate where itâs safe to fail.We all have to endure failure from time to time, whether itâs underperforming at a job interview, flunking an exam, or losing a pickup basketball game. But for people working in safety-critical industries, getting it wrong can have deadly consequences. Consider the shocking fact that preventable medical error is the third-biggest killer in the United States, causing more than 400,000 deaths every year. More people die from mistakes made by doctors and hospitals than from traffic accidents. And most of those mistakes are never made public, because of malpractice settlements with nondisclosure clauses.For a dramatically different approach to failure, look at aviation. Every passenger aircraft in the world is equipped with an almost indestructible black box. Whenever thereâs any sort of mishap, major or minor, the box is opened, the data is analyzed, and experts figure out exactly what went wrong. Then the facts are published and procedures are changed, so that the same mistakes wonât happen again. By applying this method in recent decades, the industry has created an astonishingly good safety record.Few of us put lives at risk in our daily work as surgeons and pilots do, but we all have a strong interest in avoiding predictable and preventable errors. So why donât we all embrace the aviation approach to failure rather than the health-care approach? As Matthew Syed shows in this eye-opening book, the answer is rooted in human psychology and organizational culture.Syed argues that the most important determinant of success in any field is an acknowledgment of failure and a willingness to engage with it. Yet most of us are stuck in a relationship with failure that impedes progress, halts innovation, and damages our careers and personal lives. We rarely acknowledge or learn from failureâeven though we often claim the opposite. We think we have 20/20 hindsight, but our vision is usually fuzzy.Syed draws on a wide range of sourcesâfrom anthropology and psychology to history and complexity theoryâto explore the subtle but predictable patterns of human error and our defensive responses to error. He also shares fascinating stories of individuals and organizations that have successfully embraced a black box approach to improvement, such as David Beckham, the Mercedes F1 team, and Dropbox.","['non-fiction', 'business & management', 'self improvement', 'psychology']",1,2023-12-22 00:00:00
Black Elk,Joe Jackson,/books/black-elk,"The epic life story of the Native American holy man who has inspired millions around the world.Black Elk, the Native American holy man, is known to millions of readers around the world from his 1932 testimonial, Black Elk Speaks. Adapted by the poet John Neihardt from a series of interviews, it is one of the most widely read and admired works of American Indian literature. Cryptic and deeply personal, it has been read as a spiritual guide, a philosophical manifesto, and a text to be deconstructed--while the historical Black Elk has faded from view.In this sweeping book, Joe Jackson provides the definitive biographical account of a figure whose dramatic life converged with some of the most momentous events in the history of the American West. Born in an era of rising violence, Black Elk killed his first man at Little Big Horn, witnessed the death of his second cousin Crazy Horse, and traveled to Europe with Buffalo Billâs Wild West show. Upon his return, he was swept up in the traditionalist Ghost Dance movement and shaken by the massacre at Wounded Knee. But Black Elk was not a warrior and instead choose the path of a healer and holy man, motivated by a powerful prophetic vision that haunted and inspired him, even after he converted to Catholicism in his later years.In Black Elk, Jackson has crafted a true American epic, restoring to Black Elk the richness of his times and gorgeously portraying a life of heroism and tragedy, adaptation and endurance, in an era of permanent crisis on the Great Plains.","['non-fiction', 'biographies & memoirs', 'history']",1,2020-10-24 00:00:00
Black Flags,Joby Warrick,/books/black-flags,"Joby Warrick, a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist, explains how a strain of radical Islam currently spreading throughout Iraq and Syria began in a remote Jordanian jail with the unintentional assistance of American military action.In order to smooth his transition to power after succeeding his father in 1999, Jordan's King Abdullah pardoned a group of political prisoners. He had no idea that among those freed was Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, a terrorist mastermind too deadly even for al-Qaeda, who would go on to lead an Islamist organization set on controlling the Middle East.Zarqawi began by coordinating hotel bombs and killings in Jordan from a base in northern Iraq, but it was the American invasion of Iraq in 2003 that propelled him to the forefront of a massive insurgency. The CIA accidentally created a monster by identifying him as the connection between Saddam and bin Laden. Like-minded radicals rallied to his cause, seeing him as a hero against the infidel occupiers. Their wave of beheadings and suicide bombings lasted for years, until Jordanian intelligence gave the Americans with the critical information they needed to kill Zarqawi in a 2006 airstrike.But his movement persisted, first known as al-Qaeda in Iraq and subsequently as the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, or ISIS, and sought sanctuary in insecure, ungoverned areas along the Iraq-Syria border. When the Syrian civil war erupted in 2011, ISIS grabbed the opportunity to carry out Zarqawi's vision of a vast, ultra-conservative Islamic kingdom.Joby Warrick blends combines heart-pounding, moment-by-moment operational specifics with sweeping historical perspectives to explain the lengthy history of today's most deadly Islamic extremist threat, drawing on unprecedented access to CIA and Jordanian sources.","['non-fiction', 'history', 'economics & politics', 'spirituality & religion']",1,2022-01-20 00:00:00

Black Rednecks & White Liberals,Thomas Sowell,/books/black-rednecks-white-liberals,"This book presents the kind of eye-opening insights into the history and culture of race for which Sowell has become famous. As late as the 1940s and 1950s, he argues, poor Southern rednecks were regarded by Northern employers and law enforcement officials as lazy, lawless, and sexually immoral. This pattern was repeated by blacks with whom they shared a subculture in the South. Over the last half century poor whites and most blacks have moved up in class and affluence, but the ghetto remains filled with black rednecks. Their attempt to escape, Sowell shows, is hampered by their white liberal friends who turn dysfunctional black redneck culture into a sacrosanct symbol of racial identity.

But the thirteen chapters, each a short story in its own right, create an exquisitely observed world that is anything but sleepy. A world of Kissingeresque realpolitik enacted in boysâ games on a frozen lake; of ânightcreepingâ through the summer backyards of strangers; of the tabloid-fueled thrills of the Falklands War and its human toll; of the cruel, luscious Dawn Madden and her power-hungry boyfriend, Ross Wilcox; of a certain Madame Eva van Outryve de Crommelynck, an elderly bohemian emigrÃ© who is both more and less than she appears; of Jasonâs search to replace his dead grandfatherâs irreplaceable smashed watch before the crime is discovered; of first cigarettes, first kisses, first Duran Duran LPs, and first deaths; of Margaret Thatcherâs recession; of Gypsies camping in the woods and the hysteria they inspire; and, even closer to home, of a slow-motion divorce in four seasons.Pointed, funny, profound, left-field, elegiac, and painted with the stuff of life, Black Swan Green is David Mitchellâs subtlest and most effective achievement to date.Praise for Black Swan Greenâ[David Mitchell has created] one of the most endearing, smart, and funny young narrators ever to rise up from the pages of a novel. . . .

Black and Blue,Anna Quindlen,/books/black-and-blue,"With this stunning novel about a woman and a marriage that begins in passion and becomes violent, the Pulitzer Prize--winning journalist and bestselling author of One True Thing and Object Lessons moves to a new dimension as a writer of superb fiction. ""If literature were judged solely by its ability to elicit strong emotions,"" Kirkus Reviews said about One True Thing, ""columnist-cum-novelist Quindlen would win another Pulitzer."" And the same will be said about Black and Blue, a brilliant novel of suspense, substance, and importance.In Black and Blue, Fran Benedetto tells a spellbinding story: how at nineteen she fell in love with Bobby Benedetto, how their passionate marriage became a nightmare, why she stayed, and what happened on the night she finally decided to run away with her ten-year-old son and start a new life under a new name. Living in fear in Florida--yet with increasing confidence, freedom, and hope--Fran unravels the complex threads of family, identity, and desire that shape a woman's life, even as she begins to create a new one. As Fran starts to heal from the pain of the past, she almost believes she has escaped it--that Bobby Benedetto will not find her and again provoke the complex combustion between them of attraction and destruction, lust and love.Black and Blue is a beautifully written, heart-stopping story in which Anna Quindlen writes with power, wisdom, and humor about the real lives of men and women, the varieties of people and love, the bonds between mother and child, the solace of family and friendship, the inexplicable feelings between people who are passionately connected in ways they don't understand.

Why are some people brilliant decision makers, while others are consistently inept? Why do some people follow their instincts and win, while others end up stumbling into error? How do our brains really work-in the office, in the classroom, in the kitchen, and in the bedroom?

Here, too, are great failures of ""blink"": the election of Warren Harding; ""New Coke""; and the shooting of Amadou Diallo by police.Blink reveals that great decision makers aren't those who process the most information or spend the most time deliberating, but those who have perfected the art of ""thin-slicing""-filtering the very few factors that matter from an overwhelming number of variables.","['non-fiction', 'business & management', 'science & nature', 'psychology']",5,2023-12-22 00:00:00

Blueprint,Nicholas A. Christakis,/books/blueprint,"For too long, scientists have focused on the dark side of our biological heritage: our capacity for aggression, cruelty, prejudice, and self-interest. But natural selection has given us a suite of beneficial social features, including our capacity for love, friendship, cooperation, and learning. Beneath all of our inventions -- our tools, farms, machines, cities, nations -- we carry with us innate proclivities to make a good society.In Blueprint, Nicholas A. Christakis introduces the compelling idea that our genes affect not only our bodies and behaviors, but also the ways in which we make societies, ones that are surprisingly similar worldwide.With many vivid examples -- including diverse historical and contemporary cultures, communities formed in the wake of shipwrecks, commune dwellers seeking utopia, online groups thrown together by design or involving artificially intelligent bots, and even the tender and complex social arrangements of elephants and dolphins that so resemble our own -- Christakis shows that, despite a human history replete with violence, we cannot escape our social blueprint for goodness.In a world of increasing political and economic polarization, it's tempting to ignore the positive role of our evolutionary past. But by exploring the ancient roots of goodness in civilization, Blueprint shows that our genes have shaped societies for our welfare and that, in a feedback loop stretching back many thousands of years, societies are still shaping our genes today.","['non-fiction', 'psychology', 'science & nature', 'philosophy', 'history']",2,2023-12-22 00:00:00

Now he tackles another rising global movement: our revolutionary new approach to a human inevitability--ageing.A revolution in how we age is on its way. Yes, ageing is inevitable: one year from now we will all be a year older; that will never change. What can and will change is how we age--and how we can all take a much bolder approach to doing it with vigour and joy.The time has come to cast off prejudices and to blur the lines of what is possible and permissible at every stage of life. In other words: we need to learn to re-imagine our approach to later life. Emboldening ourselves in older age demands big structural changes. For a start, we will have to tear up the old script that locks us into devoting the early part of our life to education, the middle chunk to working and raising kids, and whatever is left over at the end to leisure. In an age-inappropriate world, these silos will dissolve. We'll embrace the idea that we can carry on learning from start to finish; that we can work less and devote more time to family, leisure, and giving back to our communities in our middle years; and that we can remain active and engaged in our later years.Carl HonorÃ© has travelled the globe speaking to influential figures who are bucking preconceived notions of age, whether at work or in their personal lives. He looks at the cultural, medical, and technological developments that are opening new possibilities for us all. Bolder is a radical re-think of our approach to everything from education, healthcare and work, to design, relationships and politics.

Bonhoeffer,Eric Metaxas,/books/bonhoeffer,"As Adolf Hitler and the Nazis seduced a nation, bullied a continent, and attempted to exterminate the Jews of Europe, a small number of dissidents and saboteurs worked to dismantle the Third Reich from the inside. One of these was Dietrich Bonhoeffer--a pastor and author, known as much for such spiritual classics as ""The Cost of Discipleship ""and ""Life Together,"" as for his 1945 execution in a concentration camp for his part in the plot to assassinate Adolf Hitler.In the first major biography of Bonhoeffer in forty years, ""New York Times"" best-selling author Eric Metaxas takes both strands of Bonhoeffer's lifeâthe theologian and the spyâto tell a searing story of incredible moral courage in the face of monstrous evil.

Which is why she agrees to go to Sunshine Falls, North Carolina for the month of August when Libby begs her for a sistersâ trip awayâwith visions of a small-town transformation for Nora, who sheâs convinced needs to become the heroine in her own story.

Boom Town,Sam Anderson,/books/boom-town,"Award-winning journalist Sam Andersonâs long-awaited debut is a brilliant, kaleidoscopic narrative of Oklahoma City--a great American story of civics, basketball, and destiny.Oklahoma City was born from chaos. It was founded in a bizarre but momentous ""Land Run"" in 1889, when thousands of people lined up along the borders of Oklahoma Territory and rushed in at noon to stake their claims. Since then, it has been a city torn between the wild energy that drives its outsized ambitions, and the forces of order that seek sustainable progress. Nowhere was this dynamic better realized than in the drama of the Oklahoma City Thunder basketball team's 2012-13 season, when the Thunder's brilliant general manager, Sam Presti, ignited a firestorm by trading future superstar James Harden just days before the first game. Presti's all-in gamble on ""the Process""âthe patient, methodical management style that dictated the trade as the teamâs best hope for long-term greatnessâkicked off a pivotal year in the city's history, one that would include pitched battles over urban planning, a series of cataclysmic tornadoes, and the frenzied hope that an NBA championship might finally deliver the glory of which the city had always dreamed.Boom Town announces the arrival of an exciting literary voice. Sam Anderson, former book critic for New York magazine and now a staff writer at the New York Times magazine, unfolds an idiosyncratic mix of American history, sports reporting, urban studies, gonzo memoir, and much more to tell the strange but compelling story of an American city whose unique mix of geography and history make it a fascinating microcosm of the democratic experiment. Filled with characters ranging from NBA superstars Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook; to Flaming Lips oddball frontman Wayne Coyne; to legendary Great Plains meteorologist Gary England; to Stanley Draper, Oklahoma City's would-be Robert Moses; to civil rights activist Clara Luper; to the citizens and public servants who survived the notorious 1995 bombing of the Alfred P.

Born Standing Up,Steve Martin,/books/born-standing-up,"In the midseventies, Steve Martin exploded onto the comedy scene. By 1978 he was the biggest concert draw in the history of stand-up. In 1981 he quit forever. This book is, in his own words, the story of ""why I did stand-up and why I walked away.""Emmy and Grammy Award winner, author of the acclaimed New York Times bestsellers Shopgirl and The Pleasure of My Company, and a regular contributor to The New Yorker, Martin has always been a writer. His memoir of his years in stand-up is candid, spectacularly amusing, and beautifully written.At age ten Martin started his career at Disneyland, selling guidebooks in the newly opened theme park. In the decade that followed, he worked in the Disney magic shop and the Bird Cage Theatre at Knott's Berry Farm, performing his first magic/comedy act a dozen times a week. The story of these years, during which he practiced and honed his craft, is moving and revelatory. The dedication to excellence and innovation is formed at an astonishingly early age and never wavers or wanes.Martin illuminates the sacrifice, discipline, and originality that made him an icon and informs his work to this day. To be this good, to perform so frequently, was isolating and lonely. It took Martin decades to reconnect with his parents and sister, and he tells that story with great tenderness. Martin also paints a portrait of his times-the era of free love and protests against the war in Vietnam, the heady irreverence of The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour in the late sixties, and the transformative new voice of Saturday Night Live in the seventies.Throughout the text, Martin has placed photographs, many never seen before. Born Standing Up is a superb testament to the sheer tenacity, focus, and daring of one of the greatest and most iconoclastic comedians of all time.","['non-fiction', 'biographies & memoirs', 'arts & entertainment']",7,2023-12-22 00:00:00
Born a Crime,Trevor Noah,/books/born-a-crime,"Trevor Noahâs unlikely path from apartheid South Africa to the desk of The Daily Show began with a criminal act: his birth. Trevor was born to a white Swiss father and a black Xhosa mother at a time when such a union was punishable by five years in prison. Living proof of his parentsâ indiscretion, Trevor was kept mostly indoors for the earliest years of his life, bound by the extreme and often absurd measures his mother took to hide him from a government that could, at any moment, steal him away. Finally liberated by the end of South Africaâs tyrannical white rule, Trevor and his mother set forth on a grand adventure, living openly and freely and embracing the opportunities won by a centuries-long struggle.Born a Crime is the story of a mischievous young boy who grows into a restless young man as he struggles to find himself in a world where he was never supposed to exist. It is also the story of that young manâs relationship with his fearless, rebellious, and fervently religious motherâhis teammate, a woman determined to save her son from the cycle of poverty, violence, and abuse that would ultimately threaten her own life.The stories collected here are by turns hilarious, dramatic, and deeply affecting. Whether subsisting on caterpillars for dinner during hard times, being thrown from a moving car during an attempted kidnapping, or just trying to survive the life-and-death pitfalls of dating in high school, Trevor illuminates his curious world with an incisive wit and unflinching honesty. His stories weave together to form a moving and searingly funny portrait of a boy making his way through a damaged world in a dangerous time, armed only with a keen sense of humor and a motherâs unconventional, unconditional love.","['non-fiction', 'biographies & memoirs']",5,2023-12-22 00:00:00

Boyd,Robert Coram,/books/boyd,"John Boyd may be the most remarkable unsung hero in all of American military history. Some remember him as the greatest U.S. fighter pilot ever -- the man who, in simulated air-to-air combat, defeated every challenger in less than forty seconds. Some recall him as the father of our country's most legendary fighter aircraft -- the F-15 and F-16. Still others think of Boyd as the most influential military theorist since Sun Tzu. They know only half the story.Boyd, more than any other person, saved fighter aviation from the predations of the Strategic Air Command. His manual of fighter tactics changed the way every air force in the world flies and fights. He discovered a physical theory that forever altered the way fighter planes were designed. Later in life, he developed a theory of military strategy that has been adopted throughout the world and even applied to business models for maximizing efficiency. And in one of the most startling and unknown stories of modern military history, the Air Force fighter pilot taught the U.S. Marine Corps how to fight war on the ground. His ideas led to America's swift and decisive victory in the Gulf War and foretold the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001.On a personal level, Boyd rarely met a general he couldn't offend. He was loud, abrasive, and profane. A man of daring, ferocious passion and intractable stubbornness, he was that most American of heroes -- a rebel who cared not for his reputation or fortune but for his country. He was a true patriot, a man who made a career of challenging the shortsighted and self-serving Pentagon bureaucracy. America owes Boyd and his disciples -- the six men known as the ""Acolytes"" -- a great debt.Robert Coram finally brings to light the remarkable story of a man who polarized all who knew him, but who left a legacy that will influence the military -- and all of America -- for decades to come . . .","['non-fiction', 'biographies & memoirs', 'history']",4,2023-12-22 00:00:00

Brain Architecture,Larry W. Swanson,/books/brain-architecture,"Depending on your point of view the brain is an organ, a machine, a biological computer, or simply the most important component of the nervous system. How does it work as a whole? What are its major parts and how are they interconnected to generate thinking, feelings, and behavior? This book surveys 2,500 years of scientific thinking about these profoundly important questions from the perspective of fundamental architectural principles, and then proposes a new model for the basic plan of neural systems organization based on an explosion of structural data emerging from the neuroanatomy revolution of the 1970's.The importance of a balance between theoretical and experimental morphology is stressed throughout the book. Great advances in understanding the brain's basic plan brain have come especially from two traditional lines of biological thought- evolution and embryology, because each begins with the simple and progresses to the more complex. Understanding the organization of brain circuits, which contain thousands of links or pathways, is much more difficult. It is argued here that a four-system network model can explain the structure-function organization of the brain. Possible relationships between neural networks and gene networks revealed by the human genome project are explored in the final chapter.The book is written in clear and sparkling prose, and it is profusely illustrated. It is designed to be read by anyone with an interest in the basic organization of the brain, from neuroscience to philosophy to computer science to molecular biology. It is suitable for use in neuroscience core courses because it presents basic principles of the structure of the nervous system in a systematic way.","['non-fiction', 'science & nature']",1,2023-12-22 00:00:00

Pyle followed the soldiers into the trenches, battlefields, field hospitals, and beleaguered cities of Europe. What he witnessed he described with a clarity, sympathy, and grit that gave the public back home an immediate sense of the foot soldierâs experience.There were really two wars, John Steinbeck wrote in Time magazine: one of maps and logistics, campaigns, ballistics, divisions, and regiments and the other a ""war of the homesick, weary, funny, violent, common men who wash their socks in their helmets, complain about the food, whistle at Arab girls, or any girls for that matter, and bring themselves through as dirty a business as the world has ever seen and do it with humor and dignity and courageâand that is Ernie Pyleâs war.""

Haven't countless business gurus promised the answer, yet changed almost nothing about the way we work?That's because we fail to recognize that organizations aren't machines to be predicted and controlled. They're complex human systems full of potential waiting to be released.Dignan says you can't fix a team, department, or organization by tinkering around the edges. Over the years, he has helped his clients completely reinvent their operating systems--the fundamental principles and practices that shape their culture--with extraordinary success.Imagine a bank that abandoned traditional budgeting, only to outperform its competition for decades. An appliance manufacturer that divided itself into 2,000 autonomous teams, resulting not in chaos but rapid growth. A healthcare provider with an HQ of just 50 people supporting over 14,000 people in the field--that is named the ""best place to work"" year after year. And even a team that saved $3 million per year by cancelling one monthly meeting.Their stories may sound improbable, but in Brave New Work you'll learn exactly how they and other organizations are inventing a smarter, healthier, and more effective way to work.

"Brave, Not Perfect",Reshma Saujani,/books/brave-not-perfect,"In a book inspired by her popular TED talk, New York Times bestselling author Reshma Saujani empowers women and girls to embrace imperfection and bravery.Imagine if you lived without the fear of not being good enough. If you didn't care how your life looked on Instagram, or worry about what total strangers thought of you. Imagine if you could let go of the guilt, and stop beating yourself up for tiny mistakes. What if, in every decision you faced, you took the bolder path?Too many of us feel crushed under the weight of our own expectations. We run ourselves ragged trying to please everyone, all the time. We lose sleep ruminating about whether we may have offended someone, pass up opportunities that take us out of our comfort zones, and avoid rejection at all costs.There's a reason we act this way, Reshma says. As girls, we were taught to play it safe. Well-meaning parents and teachers praised us for being quiet and polite, urged us to be careful so we didn't get hurt, and steered us to activities at which we could shine.The problem is that perfect girls grow up to be women who are afraid to fail. It's time to stop letting our fears drown out our dreams and narrow our world, along with our chance at happiness.By choosing bravery over perfection, we can find the power to claim our voice, to leave behind what makes us unhappy, and go for the things we genuinely, passionately want. Perfection may set us on a path that feels safe, but bravery leads us to the one we're authentically meant to follow.In Brave, Not Perfect, Reshma shares powerful insights and practices to help us override our perfect girl training and make bravery a lifelong habit. By being brave, not perfect, we can all become the authors of our biggest, boldest, and most joyful life.","['non-fiction', 'self improvement']",1,2020-10-24 00:00:00

Braving the Wilderness,BrenÃ© Brown,/books/braving-the-wilderness,"#1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER - A timely and important new book that challenges everything we think we know about cultivating true belonging in our communities, organizations, and culture, from the #1 bestselling author of Rising Strong, Daring Greatly, and The Gifts of Imperfection.â""True belonging doesn't require us to change who we are. It requires us to be who we are."" Social scientist Brene Brown, PhD, LMSW, has sparked a global conversation about the experiences that bring meaning to our lives--experiences of courage, vulnerability, love, belonging, shame, and empathy. In Braving the Wilderness, Brown redefines what it means to truly belong in an age of increased polarization. With her trademark mix of research, storytelling, and honesty, Brown will again change the cultural conversation while mapping a clear path to true belonging.Brown argues that we're experiencing a spiritual crisis of disconnection, and introduces four practices of true belonging that challenge everything we believe about ourselves and each other. She writes, ""True belonging requires us to believe in and belong to ourselves so fully that we can find sacredness both in being a part of something and in standing alone when necessary. But in a culture that's rife with perfectionism and pleasing, and with the erosion of civility, it's easy to stay quiet, hide in our ideological bunkers, or fit in rather than show up as our true selves and brave the wilderness of uncertainty and criticism. But true belonging is not something we negotiate or accomplish with others; it's a daily practice that demands integrity and authenticity. It's a personal commitment that we carry in our hearts."" Brown offers us the clarity and courage we need to find our way back to ourselves and to each other. And that path cuts right through the wilderness. Brown writes, ""The wilderness is an untamed, unpredictable place of solitude and searching. It is a place as dangerous as it is breathtaking, a place as sought after as it is feared. But it turns out to be the place of true belonging, and it's the bravest and most sacred place you will ever stand.""","['non-fiction', 'self improvement', 'psychology']",1,2023-12-22 00:00:00

Nestor tracks down men and women exploring the hidden science behind ancient breathing practices like Pranayama, Sudarshan Kriya, and Tummo and teams up with pulmonary tinkerers to scientifically test long-held beliefs about how we breathe.Modern research is showing us that making even slight adjustments to the way we inhale and exhale can jump-start athletic performance; rejuvenate internal organs; halt snoring, asthma, and autoimmune disease; and even straighten scoliotic spines. None of this should be possible, and yet it is.Drawing on thousands of years of medical texts and recent cutting-edge studies in pulmonology, psychology, biochemistry, and human physiology, Breath turns the conventional wisdom of what we thought we knew about our most basic biological function on its head. You will never breathe the same again.","['non-fiction', 'health & fitness', 'science & nature', 'self improvement']",3,2023-01-02 00:00:00
Breath from Salt,Bijal P. Trivedi,/books/breath-from-salt,"""Elaborating on the science as well as the business behind the fight against cystic fibrosis, Trivedi captures the emotions of the families, doctors, and scientists involved in the clinical trials and their 'weeping with joy' as new drugs are approved, and shows how cystic fibrosis, once a 'death sentence,' became, for many, a manageable condition. This is a rewarding and challenging work.""âPublishers WeeklyCystic fibrosis was once a mysterious disease that killed infants and children. Now it could be the key to healing millions with genetic diseases of every typeâfrom Alzheimer's and Parkinson's to diabetes and sickle cell anemia.In 1974, Joey O'Donnell was born with strange symptoms. His insatiable appetite, incessant vomiting, and a relentless coughâwhich shook his tiny, fragile body and made it difficult to draw breathâconfounded doctors and caused his parents agonizing, sleepless nights. After six sickly months, his salty skin provided the critical clue: he was one of thousands of Americans with cystic fibrosis, an inherited lung disorder that would most likely kill him before his first birthday.The gene and mutation responsible for CF were found in 1989âdiscoveries that promised to lead to a cure for kids like Joey. But treatments unexpectedly failed and CF was deemed incurable. It was only after the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, a grassroots organization founded by parents, formed an unprecedented partnership with a fledgling biotech company that transformative leaps in drug development were harnessed to produce groundbreaking new treatments: pills that could fix the crippled protein at the root of this deadly disease.From science writer Bijal P. Trivedi, Breath from Salt chronicles the riveting saga of cystic fibrosis, from its ancient origins to its identification in the dank autopsy room of a hospital basement, and from the CF gene's celebrated status as one of the first human disease genes ever discovered to the groundbreaking targeted genetic therapies that now promise to cure it.Told from the perspectives of the patients, families, physicians, scientists, and philanthropists fighting on the front lines, Breath from Salt is a remarkable story of unlikely scientific and medical firsts, of setbacks and successes, and of people who refused to give up hopeâand a fascinating peek into the future of genetics and medicine.","['non-fiction', 'science & nature', 'health & fitness']",1,2020-12-09 00:00:00

Vastly outnumbered, women face toxic workplaces rife with discrimination and sexual harassment, where investors take meetings in hot tubs and network at sex parties.In this powerful exposÃ©, Bloomberg TV journalist Emily Chang reveals how Silicon Valley got so sexist despite its utopian ideals, why bro culture endures despite decades of companies claiming the moral high ground (Don't Be Evil! Connect the World!)--and how women are finally starting to speak out and fight back.Drawing on her deep network of Silicon Valley insiders, Chang opens the boardroom doors of male-dominated venture capital firms like Kleiner Perkins, the subject of Ellen Pao's high-profile gender discrimination lawsuit, and Sequoia, where a partner once famously said they ""won't lower their standards"" just to hire women. Interviews with Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg, YouTube CEO Susan Wojcicki, and former Yahoo! CEO Marissa Mayer--who got their start at Google, where just one in five engineers is a woman--reveal just how hard it is to crack the Silicon Ceiling. And Chang shows how women such as former Uber engineer Susan Fowler, entrepreneur Niniane Wang, and game developer Brianna Wu, have risked their careers and sometimes their lives to pave a way for other women.Silicon Valley's aggressive, misogynistic, work-at-all costs culture has shut women out of the greatest wealth creation in the history of the world.

Bush as the chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) in 2006, she witnessed the origins of the financial crisis and in 2008 becameâalong with Hank Paulson, Ben Bernanke, and Timothy Geithnerâone of the key players trying to repair the damage to our economy. Bull by the Horns is her remarkable and refreshingly honest account of that contentious time and the struggle for reform that followed and continues to this day.","['non-fiction', 'economics & politics', 'money & investing', 'business & management', 'history']",1,2023-12-22 00:00:00

Bullet Points and Punch Lines,Lee Champ,/books/bullet-points-and-punch-lines,"Our US empire is in steep decline. In order to wrest complete control over the globe and feed a rapacious thirst for resources and wealth, the American ruling elite is wreaking havoc around the world. Meanwhile, average Americans are suffering, legs trembling under a mountain of debt as they toil at unfulfilling, underpaying jobs. And those with enough time and energy to get angry and fight back are told that the answer is to vote for one of the two pro-war, pro&ndash;Wall Street corporate parties claiming to be their savior. This epic tragedy does not sound like the beginning of a joke. But somehow comedian and TV host Lee Camp makes it both funny and interesting. Whether he is setting his sights on the scandal of $21 trillion worth of unaccounted-for financial adjustments at the Pentagon or the scorching environmental and human tragedy caused by climate chaos, it's unsurprising that one of our most incisive political commentators is technically a comedian. Camp knifes his way through the jungle of fake news, alternative facts, mainstream media lies, and government blackouts, trailblazing a path between Hunter S. Thompson and Jon Stewart. Perhaps the present-day story of America can only accurately be told by a comedian, otherwise no one would believe it. In a world where con men are heralded as leaders, locking up peace activists is perceived as justice, trumpeting state propaganda is considered journalism, and mocking environmentalists is championed as strength, it's only appropriate that a comedian is viewed as more reliable than the evening news.","['non-fiction', 'economics & politics']",1,2020-09-27 00:00:00

Burr,Gore Vidal,/books/burr,"For readers who canât get enough of the hit Broadway musical Hamilton, Gore Vidalâs stunning novel about Aaron Burr, the man who killed Alexander Hamilton in a duelâand who served as a successful, if often feared, statesman of our fledgling nation. Â  Here is an extraordinary portrait of one of the most complicatedâand misunderstoodâfigures among the Founding Fathers. In 1804, while serving as vice president, Aaron Burr fought a duel with his political nemesis, Alexander Hamilton, and killed him. In 1807, he was arrested, tried, and acquitted of treason. In 1833, Burr is newly married, an aging statesman considered a monster by many. But he is determined to tell his own story, and he chooses to confide in a young New York City journalist named Charles Schermerhorn Schuyler. Together, they explore both Burr's pastâand the continuing civic drama of their young nation. Burr is the first novel in Gore Vidal's Narratives of Empire series, which spans the history of the United States from the Revolution to post-World War II. With their broad canvas and sprawling cast of fictional and historical characters, these novels present a panorama of American politics and imperialism, as interpreted by one of our most incisive and ironic observers.","['fiction', 'economics & politics']",1,2023-12-22 00:00:00

But How Do It Know?,J. Clark Scott,/books/but-how-do-it-know,"Finally, this brand new book exposes the secrets of computers for everyone to see. Its humorous title begins with the punch line of a classic joke about someone who is baffled by technology.It was written by a 40-year computer veteran who wants to take the mystery out of computers and allow everyone to gain a true understanding of exactly what computers are, and also what they are not.Years of writing, diagramming, piloting and editing have culminated in one easy to read volume that contains all of the basic principles of computers written so that everyone can understand them.There used to be only two types of book that delved into the insides of computers. The simple ones point out the major parts and describe their functions in broad general terms. Computer Science textbooks eventually tell the whole story, but along the way, they include every detail that an engineer could conceivably ever need to know.Like Momma Bear's porridge, But How Do It Know? is just right, but it is much more than just a happy medium. For the first time, this book thoroughly demonstrates each of the basic principles that have been used in every computer ever built, while at the same time showing the integral role that codes play in everything that computers are able to do.It cuts through all of the electronics and mathematics, and gets right to practical matters. Here is a simple part, see what it does. Connect a few of these together and you get a new part that does another simple thing. After just a few iterations of connecting up simple parts - voilÃ ! - it's a computer. And it is much simpler than anyone ever imagined.But How Do It Know? really explains how computers work. They are far simpler than anyone has ever permitted you to believe. It contains everything you need to know, and nothing you don't need to know. No technical background of any kind is required.The basic principles of computers have not changed one iota since they were invented in the mid 20th century. ""Since the day I learned how computers work, it always felt like I knew a giant secret, but couldn't tell anyone,"" says the author. Now he's taken the time to explain it in such a manner that anyone can have that same moment of enlightenment and thereafter see computers in an entirely new light.","['non-fiction', 'science & nature', 'technology']",1,2020-12-31 00:00:00

It has developed out of our own preferences for living in a modern way."" California design influenced the material culture of the entire country, in everything from architecture to fashion. This generously illustrated book, which accompanies a major exhibition at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, is the first comprehensive examination of California's mid-century modern design. It begins by tracing the origins of a distinctively California modernism in the 1930s by such European Ã©migrÃ©s as Richard Neutra, Rudolph Schindler, and Kem Weber; it finds other specific design influences and innovations in solid-color commercial ceramics, inspirations from Mexico and Asia, new schools for design training, new concepts about leisure, and the conversion of wartime technologies to peacetime use (exemplified by Charles and Ray Eames's plywood and fiberglass furniture).The heart of California Design is the modern California home, famously characterized by open plans conducive to outdoor living. The layouts of modernist homes by Pierre Koenig, Craig Ellwood, and Raphael Soriano, for example, were intended to blur the distinction between indoors and out. Homes were furnished with products from Heath Ceramics, Van Keppel-Green, and Architectural Pottery as well as other, previously unheralded companies and designers. Many objects were designed to be multifunctional: pool and patio furniture that was equally suitable indoors, lighting that was both task and ambient, bookshelves that served as room dividers, and bathing suits that would turn into ensembles appropriate for indoor entertainment. California Design includes 350 images, most in color, of furniture, ceramics, metalwork, architecture, graphic and industrial design, film, textiles, and fashion, and ten incisive essays that trace the rise of the California design aesthetic.","['non-fiction', 'arts & entertainment', 'design']",1,2020-05-14 00:00:00

Along the way, Mattis recounts his foundational experiences as a leader, extracting the lessons he has learned about the nature of warfighting and peacemaking, the importance of allies, and the strategic dilemmas--and short-sighted thinking--now facing our nation. He makes it clear why America must return to a strategic footing so as not to continue winning battles but fighting inconclusive wars.Mattis divides his book into three parts: Direct Leadership, Executive Leadership, and Strategic Leadership. In the first part, Mattis recalls his early experiences leading Marines into battle, when he knew his troops as well as his own brothers. In the second part, he explores what it means to command thousands of troops and how to adapt your leadership style to ensure your intent is understood by your most junior troops so that they can own their mission. In the third part, Mattis describes the challenges and techniques of leadership at the strategic level, where military leaders reconcile war's grim realities with political leaders' human aspirations, where complexity reigns and the consequences of imprudence are severe, even catastrophic.âCall Sign Chaos is a memoir of a life of warfighting and lifelong learning, following along as Mattis rises from Marine recruit to four-star general. It is a journey about learning to lead and a story about how he, through constant study and action, developed a unique leadership philosophy, one relevant to us all.","['non-fiction', 'biographies & memoirs', 'history', 'economics & politics']",1,2023-12-22 00:00:00
Callings,Gregg Levoy,/books/callings,"How do we know if we're following our true callings? How do we sharpen our senses to cut through the distractions of everyday reality and hear the calls that are beckoning us?This is the first book to examine the many kinds of calls we receive and the great variety of channels through which they come to us. A calling may be to do something (change careers, go back to school, have a child) or to be something (more creative, less judgmental, more loving). While honoring a calling's essential mystery, this book also guides readers to ask and answer the fundamental questions that arise from any calling: How do we recognize it? How do we distinguish the true call from the siren song? How do we handle our resistance to a call? What happens when we say yes?

Can We Talk About Something More Pleasant?,Roz Chast,/books/can-we-talk-about-something-more-pleasant,"Roz Chast's debut book tackles the problem of ageing parents with her trademark humor. Chast's book provides both comfort and comedic relief for anybody dealing with the life-altering death of elderly parents. It spans several years of their lives and is conveyed through four-color cartoons, family pictures, and documents, as well as a narrative as replete with chuckles as it is with tears.Roz used denial, evasion, and diversion when it came to her ageing mother and father. The tools that had served Roz well through her parents' seventies, eighties, and early nineties could no longer be used when Elizabeth Chast scaled a ladder to seek an old relic from the ""crazy closet""âwith predictable results.While the specifics are Chast-ian in their eccentricitiesâan anxious father who had relied heavily on his wife for stability as he slipped into dementia and a former assistant principal mother whose overbearing personality had kept Roz out of the classroom for decadesâthe themes are universal: adult children accepting parental roles; ageing and unstable parents leaving a family home for an institution; dealing with uncomfortable physical intimacies; managing logistics; and hiring stray children.Can't We Talk About Something More Pleasant is a stunning depiction of two lives at their end and an only kid coping as best she can.

In brilliantly skewering such naÃ¯vetÃ©, Voltaire mercilessly exposes and satirizes romance, science, philosophy, religion, and government â the ideas and forces that permeate and control the lives of men. After many trials and travails, Candide is reunited with Cunegonde, his sweetheart. He then buys a little farm in Turkey where he and Cunegonde, Dr. Pangloss and others all retire.

Capitalism Without Capital,Jonathan Haskel,/books/capitalism-without-capital,"The first comprehensive account of the growing dominance of the intangible economyEarly in the twenty-first century, a quiet revolution occurred. For the first time, the major developed economies began to invest more in intangible assets, like design, branding, R&D, and software, than in tangible assets, like machinery, buildings, and computers. For all sorts of businesses, from tech firms and pharma companies to coffee shops and gyms, the ability to deploy assets that one can neither see nor touch is increasingly the main source of long-term success.But this is not just a familiar story of the so-called new economy. Capitalism without Capital shows that the growing importance of intangible assets has also played a role in some of the big economic changes of the last decade. The rise of intangible investment is, Jonathan Haskel and Stian Westlake argue, an underappreciated cause of phenomena from economic inequality to stagnating productivity.Haskel and Westlake bring together a decade of research on how to measure intangible investment and its impact on national accounts, showing the amount different countries invest in intangibles, how this has changed over time, and the latest thinking on how to assess this. They explore the unusual economic characteristics of intangible investment, and discuss how these features make an intangible-rich economy fundamentally different from one based on tangibles.Capitalism without Capital concludes by presenting three possible scenarios for what the future of an intangible world might be like, and by outlining how managers, investors, and policymakers can exploit the characteristics of an intangible age to grow their businesses, portfolios, and economies.","['non-fiction', 'business & management', 'economics & politics']",1,2023-12-22 00:00:00

Catastrophe 1914,Max Hasting,/books/catastrophe-1914,"From the acclaimed military historian, a history of the outbreak of World War I: the dramatic stretch from the breakdown of diplomacy to the battlesâthe Marne, Ypres, Tannenbergâthat marked the frenzied first year before the war bogged down in the trenches.In Catastrophe 1914, Max Hastings gives us a conflict different from the familiar one of barbed wire, mud and futility. He traces the path to war, making clear why Germany and Austria-Hungary were primarily to blame, and describes the gripping first clashes in the West, where the French army marched into action in uniforms of red and blue with flags flying and bands playing. In August, four days after the French suffered 27,000 men dead in a single day, the British fought an extraordinary holding action against oncoming Germans, one of the last of its kind in history. In October, at terrible cost the British held the allied line against massive German assaults in the first battle of Ypres. Hastings also re-creates the lesser-known battles on the Eastern Front, brutal struggles in Serbia, East Prussia and Galicia, where the Germans, Austrians, Russians and Serbs inflicted three million casualties upon one another by Christmas. As he has done in his celebrated, award-winning works on World War II, Hastings gives us frank assessments of generals and political leaders and masterly analyses of the political currents that led the continent to war. He argues passionately against the contention that the war was not worth the cost, maintaining that Germanyâs defeat was vital to the freedom of Europe. Throughout we encounter statesmen, generals, peasants, housewives and private soldiers of seven nations in Hastingsâs accustomed blend of top-down and bottom-up accounts: generals dismounting to lead troops in bayonet charges over 1,500 feet of open ground; farmers who at first decried the requisition of their horses; infantry men engaged in a haggard retreat, sleeping four hours a night in their haste. This is a vivid new portrait of how a continent became embroiled in war and what befell millions of men and women in a conflict that would change everything.","['non-fiction', 'history', 'economics & politics']",1,2020-10-24 00:00:00
Catastrophic Care,David Goldhill,/books/catastrophic-care,"A visionary and completely original investigation that will change the way we think about health care: how and why it is failing, why expanding insurance coverage will only make things worse, and how it can be transformed into a transparent, affordable, successful system.In 2007, David Goldhill's father died from a series of infections acquired in a well-regarded New York hospital. The bill was for several hundred thousand dollars--and Medicare paid it. These circumstances left Goldhill angry and determined to understand how it was possible that world-class technology and well-trained personnel could result in such simple, inexcusable carelessness--and how a business that failed so miserably could be rewarded with full payment. Catastrophic Care is the eye-opening result. Goldhill explicates a health-care system that now costs nearly $2.5 trillion annually, bars many from treatment, provides inconsistent quality of care, offers negligible customer service, and in which an estimated 200,000 Americans die each year from errors. Above all, he exposes the fundamental fallacy of our entire system--that Medicare and insurance coverage make care cheaper and improve our health--and suggests a comprehensive new approach that could produce better results at more acceptable costs immediately by giving us, the patients, a real role in the process.","['non-fiction', 'economics & politics', 'health & fitness']",1,2023-12-22 00:00:00
Catch and Kill,Ronan Farrow,/books/catch-and-kill,"In a dramatic account of violence and espionage, Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative reporter Ronan Farrow exposes serial abusers and a cabal of powerful interests hell-bent on covering up the truth, at any cost.In 2017, a routine network television investigation led Ronan Farrow to a story only whispered about: one of Hollywood's most powerful producers was a predator, protected by fear, wealth, and a conspiracy of silence. As Farrow drew closer to the truth, shadowy operatives, from high-priced lawyers to elite war-hardened spies, mounted a secret campaign of intimidation, threatening his career, following his every move and weaponizing an account of abuse in his own family. All the while, Farrow and his producer faced a degree of resistance that could not be explained - until now. And a trail of clues revealed corruption and cover-ups from Hollywood, to Washington, and beyond. This is the untold story of the exotic tactics of surveillance and intimidation deployed by wealthy and connected men to threaten journalists, evade accountability and silence victims of abuse - and it's the story of the women who risked everything to expose the truth and spark a global movement.Both a spy thriller and a meticulous work of investigative journalism, Catch and Kill breaks devastating new stories about the rampant abuse of power - and sheds far-reaching light on investigations that shook the culture.","['non-fiction', 'economics & politics']",3,2023-12-22 00:00:00

In recent years it has been named to âbest novelsâ lists by Time, Newsweek, the Modern Library, and the London Observer.Set in Italy during World War II, this is the story of the incomparable, malingering bombardier, Yossarian, a hero who is furious because thousands of people he has never met are trying to kill him. But his real problem is not the enemyâit is his own army, which keeps increasing the number of missions the men must fly to complete their service. Yet if Yossarian makes any attempt to excuse himself from the perilous missions heâs assigned, heâll be in violation of Catch-22, a hilariously sinister bureaucratic rule: a man is considered insane if he willingly continues to fly dangerous combat missions, but if he makes a formal request to be removed from duty, he is proven sane and therefore ineligible to be relieved.This fiftieth-anniversary edition commemorates Joseph Hellerâs masterpiece with a new introduction by Christopher Buckley; a wealth of critical essays and reviews by Norman Mailer, Alfred Kazin, Anthony Burgess, and others; rare papers and photos from Joseph Hellerâs personal archive; and much more.

Catching the Big Fish,David Lynch,/books/catching-the-big-fish,"In Catching the Big Fish, internationally acclaimed filmmaker David Lynch provides a rare window into his methods as an artist, his personal working style, and the immense creative benefits he has experienced from the practice of meditation.Lynch describes the experience of ""diving within"" and ""catching"" ideas like fish - and then preparing them for television or movie screens, and other mediums in which he works, such as painting, music, and design. Lynch writes for the first time about his more than three-decade commitment to Transcendental Meditation and the difference it has made in his creative process.In brief chapters, Lynch explains the development of his ideas - where they came from, how he grasps them, and which ones appeal to him the most. He specifically discusses how he puts his thoughts into action and how he engages with others around him. Finally, he considers the self and the surrounding world - and how the process of ""diving within"" that has so deeply affected his own work can directly benefit others.âCatching the Big Fish comes as a revelation to the legion of fans who have longed to better understand Lynch's personal vision. And it is equally intriguing to those who wonder how they can nurture their own creativity.","['non-fiction', 'philosophy', 'arts & entertainment']",2,2023-12-22 00:00:00
Catherine the Great,Robert K. Massie,/books/catherine-the-great,"The Pulitzer Prizeâwinning author of Peter the Great, Nicholas and Alexandra, and The Romanovs returns with another masterpiece of narrative biography, the extraordinary story of an obscure young German princess who traveled to Russia at fourteen and rose to become one of the most remarkable, powerful, and captivating women in history.Born into a minor noble family, Catherine transformed herself into Empress of Russia by sheer determination. Possessing a brilliant mind and an insatiable curiosity as a young woman, she devoured the works of Enlightenment philosophers and, when she reached the throne, attempted to use their principles to guide her rule of the vast and backward Russian empire. She knew or corresponded with the preeminent historical figures of her time: Voltaire, Diderot, Frederick the Great, Empress Maria Theresa of Austria, Marie Antoinette, and, surprisingly, the American naval hero, John Paul Jones.Reaching the throne fired by Enlightenment philosophy and determined to become the embodiment of the âbenevolent despotâ idealized by Montesquieu, she found herself always contending with the deeply ingrained realities of Russian life, including serfdom. She persevered, and for thirty-four years the government, foreign policy, cultural development, and welfare of the Russian people were in her hands. She dealt with domestic rebellion, foreign wars, and the tidal wave of political change and violence churned up by the French Revolution that swept across Europe. Her reputation depended entirely on the perspective of the speaker. She was praised by Voltaire as the equal of the greatest of classical philosophers; she was condemned by her enemies, mostly foreign, as âthe Messalina of the north.âCatherineâs family, friends, ministers, generals, lovers, and enemiesâall are here, vividly described. These included her ambitious, perpetually scheming mother; her weak, bullying husband, Peter (who left her lying untouched beside him for nine years after their marriage); her unhappy son and heir, Paul; her beloved grandchildren; and her âfavoritesââthe parade of young men from whom she sought companionship and the recapture of youth as well as sex. Here, too, is the giant figure of Gregory Potemkin, her most significant lover and possible husband, with whom she shared a passionate correspondence of love and separation, followed by seventeen years of unparalleled mutual achievement.The story is superbly told. All the special qualities that Robert K. Massie brought to Nicholas and Alexandra and Peter the Great are present here: historical accuracy, depth of understanding, felicity of style, mastery of detail, ability to shatter myth, and a rare genius for finding and expressing the human drama in extraordinary lives.History offers few stories richer in drama than that of Catherine the Great. In this book, this eternally fascinating woman is returned to life.","['non-fiction', 'biographies & memoirs', 'economics & politics', 'history']",2,2023-12-22 00:00:00

Broad in scope and revealing the depth of his knowledge, these teachings display the range of the Dalai Lama and his message, covering a plethora of topics, including: the need for compassion, the common goals of the world's religions, karma, the four noble truths, the luminous nature of the mind, meditative concentration, selflessness, the two truths, and the fundamental innate mind of clear light that all the various schools of Tibetan Buddhism aim at manifesting. Although others in Tibet have mentioned that all orders of Tibetan Buddhism have the same basic outlook, the Dalai Lama is the first to explain in detail how this is so, his brilliant syncretic exposition being the final chapter in this book.The book's twenty chapters are deftly arranged in a developmental sequence so that readers easily understand the background needed to appreciate the more complex, later topics.

Certain to Win,Chet Richards,/books/certain-to-win,"Boyd did pursue a business degree. He read everything he could get his hands on about the Toyota Production System and came to see it as a realisation of ideas similar to his own. He considered business when developing the final version of his ""OODA loop"" and in his most recent major briefing on science and technology, Conceptual Spiral. He read and commented on early draughts of this manuscript, but he never wrote about how businesses could be more profitable by implementing his ideas.Other authors and business strategists have taken up the challenge, introducing Boyd's ideas and suggesting business applications. The OODA loop and its effects on competitors have been described by Keith Hammonds in Fast Company, George Stalk and Tom Hout in Competing Against Time, and Tom Peters most recently in Re-imagine!They made substantial contributions. Successful businesses, on the other hand, focus on enticing customers rather than influencing competitors. You could apply Boyd to competitors all you wanted, but unless this resulted in customers purchasing your products and services, you've squandered your time and money. If this were all there was to Boyd, he would be considered a minor player in business strategy.Boyd's focus on war, where ""affecting competitors"" is the whole idea, has been part of the problem. For nearly 50 years, he was involved in armed conflict, first as a fighter pilot, then as a tactician and instructor of fighter pilots, and finally, after retirement, as a military philosopher. Coram describes (and I have personal experience with this) how his quest consumed Boyd's nearly every waking hour.It was not a monastic existence, though, since John was above everything else a competitor and loved to argue over beer and cigars far into the night. During most of the 1970s and 80s he worked at the Pentagon, where he could share ideas and debate with other strategists and practitioners of the art of war. The result was the remarkable synthesis we know as Patterns of Conflict.ââ","['business & management', 'non-fiction', 'psychology']",1,2022-01-20 00:00:00

Change.edu,Andrew S. Rosen,/books/changeedu,"Itâs no wonder American higher education is facing a crisis.While low-income students canât find a spot in their local community colleges for lack of funding, public four-year universities are spending staggering sums on luxurious residence halls, ever-bigger football stadiums, and obscure research institutes. We have cosseted our most advantaged students even as we deny access to the working adults who urgently need higher education to advance their careers and our economy. In Change.edu: Rebooting for the new talent economy Andrew S. Rosen clearly and entertainingly details how far the American higher education system has strayed from the goals of access, quality, affordability, and accountability that should characterize our system, and offers a prescription to restore American educational pre-eminence.To change, our system will have to end its reflexive opposition to anything new and different. Rosen describes how each new wave of innovation and expansion of educational accessâ starting with the founding of Harvard in 1636, and continuing with the advent of land-grant colleges in the 19th century, community colleges in the 20th century and private sector colleges over the last two decadesâhas been met with misunderstanding and ridicule. When colleges like the University of California, Cornell and Purdue were founded, they were scorned as âpretenders to the title of universityâ â language that tracks later criticisms of community colleges and most recently for-profit colleges.Avoiding that condescension is just one of the reasons colleges have come under the sway of âHarvard Envyâ â schools that were founded to expand access feel an inexorable tug to become more prestigious and exclusive. Even worse, the competition for the best students has led universities to turn themselves into full-fledged resorts; theyâve built climbing walls, French bistros and 20-person hot-tubs to entice students to their campuses.How can America address an incentive system in higher education that is mismatched to the challenges of the years ahead? In Change.edu, Rosen outlines âseven certaintiesâ of education in the coming 25 years, and presents an imperative for how our system must prepare for the coming changes. He proposes a new âplaybookâ for dealing with the change ahead, one that will enable American higher education to regain its global primacy and be a catalyst for economic growth in the 21st century.","['non-fiction', 'economics & politics', 'business & management']",1,2023-12-22 00:00:00

Chozickâs front-row seat, initially covering Clintonâs imploding 2008 campaign, and then her assignment to âThe Hillary Beatâ ahead of the 2016 election, took her to 48 states and set off a nearly ten-years-long journey in which the formative years of her twenties and thirties became â both personally and professionally â intrinsically intertwined to Clintonâs presidential ambitions.Chozickâs candor and clear-eyed perspectiveâfrom her seat on the Hillary bus and reporting from inside the campaignâs Brooklyn headquarters, to her run-ins with Donald J. Trump and her globetrotting with Bill Clintonâ provide fresh intrigue and insights into the story we thought we all knew. This is the real story of what happened, with the kind of dishy, inside details that repeatedly surprise and enlighten.But Chasing Hillary is also a rollicking, irreverent, refreshingly honest personal story of how the would-be first woman president looms over Chozickâs life. And, as she gets married, attempts to infiltrate the upper echelons of political journalism and inquires about freezing her eggs so she can have children after the 2016 campaign, Chozick dives deeper into decisions Clinton made at similar points in her life. In the process, Chozick came to see Clinton not as an unknowable enigma and political animal but as a complex person, full of contradictions and forged in the political battles and media storms that had long predated Chozickâs years of coverage. Trailing Clinton through all of the highs and lows of the most noxious and wildly dramatic presidential election in American history, Chozick comes to understand what drove Clinton, how she accomplished what no woman had before, and why she ultimately failed. Poignant, illuminating, laugh-out-loud funny, Chasing Hillary is a campaign book like never before that reads like a fast-moving political novel.","['non-fiction', 'economics & politics']",1,2023-12-22 00:00:00

Floating in and out of consciousness, Fajgenbaum prayed for a second chance, the equivalent of a dramatic play to second the game into overtime.Miraculously, Fajgenbaum survived--only to endure repeated near-death relapses from what would eventually be identified as a form of Castleman disease, an extremely deadly and rare condition that acts like a cross between cancer and an autoimmune disorder. When he relapsed while on the only drug in development and realized that the medical community was unlikely to make progress in time to save his life, Fajgenbaum turned his desperate hope for a cure into concrete action: Between hospitalizations he studied his own charts and tested his own blood samples, looking for clues that could unlock a new treatment. With the help of family, friends, and mentors, he also reached out to other Castleman disease patients and physicians, and eventually came up with an ambitious plan to crowdsource the most promising research questions and recruit world-class researchers to tackle them. Instead of waiting for the scientific stars to align, he would attempt to align them himself.More than five years later and now married to his college sweetheart, Fajgenbaum has seen his hard work pay off: A treatment he identified has induced a tentative remission and his novel approach to collaborative scientific inquiry has become a blueprint for advancing rare disease research. His incredible story demonstrates the potency of hope, and what can happen when the forces of determination, love, family, faith, and serendipity collide.","['non-fiction', 'biographies & memoirs', 'science & nature']",1,2020-10-24 00:00:00

China Airborne,James Fallows,/books/china-airborne,"More than two-thirds of the new airports under construction today are being built in China. Chinese airlines expect to triple their fleet size over the next decade and will account for the fastest-growing market for Boeing and Airbus. But the Chinese are determined to be more than customers. In 2011, China announced its Twelfth Five-Year Plan, which included the commitment to spend a quarter of a trillion dollars to jump-start its aerospace industry. Its goal is to produce the Boeings and Airbuses of the future. Toward that end, it acquired two American companies: Cirrus Aviation, maker of the worldâs most popular small propeller plane, and Teledyne Continental, which produces the engines for Cirrus and other small aircraft. In China Airborne, James Fallows documents, for the first time, the extraordinary scale of this project and explains why it is a crucial test case for Chinaâs hopes for modernization and innovation in other industries. He makes clear how it stands to catalyze the nationâs hyper-growth and hyper- urbanization, revolutionizing China in ways analogous to the building of Americaâs transcontinental railroad in the nineteenth century. Fallows chronicles life in the city of Xiâan, home to more than 250,000 aerospace engineers and assembly workers, and introduces us to some of the hucksters, visionaries, entrepreneurs, and dreamers who seek to benefit from Chinaâs pursuit of aerospace supremacy. He concludes by examining what this latest demonstration of Chinese ambition means for the United States and the rest of the worldâand the right ways to understand it.","['non-fiction', 'economics & politics', 'business & management']",1,2023-12-22 00:00:00

I felt like it was looking right at me and nobody else."" So writes Bob Dylan in Chronicles: Volume One, his remarkable book exploring critical junctures in his life and career.Through Dylan's eyes and open mind, we see Greenwich Village, circa 1961, when he first arrives in Manhattan.

A brilliant feat of storytelling, monumental in scope, yet put together with tenderness for a man who had always believed that he would be Britainâs savior.â âWall Street JournalIn this landmark biography of Winston Churchill based on extensive new material, the true genius of the man, statesman and leader can finally be fully seen and understood--by the bestselling, award-winning author of Napoleon and The Storm of War.When we seek an example of great leaders with unalloyed courage, the person who comes to mind is Winston Churchill: the iconic, visionary war leader immune from the consensus of the day, who stood firmly for his beliefs when everyone doubted him. But how did young Winston become Churchill? What gave him the strength to take on the superior force of Nazi Germany when bombs rained on London and so many others had caved? In Churchill, Andrew Roberts gives readers the full and definitive Winston Churchill, from birth to lasting legacy, as personally revealing as it is compulsively readable.Roberts gained exclusive access to extensive new material: transcripts of War Cabinet meetings, diaries, letters and unpublished memoirs from Churchill's contemporaries. The Royal Family permitted Roberts--in a first for a Churchill biographer--to read the detailed notes taken by King George VI in his diary after his weekly meetings with Churchill during World War II. This treasure trove of access allows Roberts to understand the man in revelatory new ways, and to identify the hidden forces fueling Churchill's legendary drive.We think of Churchill as a hero who saved civilization from the evils of Nazism and warned of the grave crimes of Soviet communism, but Roberts's masterwork reveals that he has as much to teach us about the challenges leaders face today--and the fundamental values of courage, tenacity, leadership and moral conviction.","['non-fiction', 'economics & politics', 'biographies & memoirs', 'history']",1,2023-12-22 00:00:00

But now heâs finally able to tell the full story about some of the biggest controversies of the War on Terror, in a memoir that reads like a thriller.","['non-fiction', 'biographies & memoirs', 'economics & politics', 'history']",1,2023-12-22 00:00:00
Civilisation,Kenneth Clark,/books/civilisation,"Kenneth Clark's sweeping narrative looks at how Western Europe evolved in the wake of the collapse of the Roman Empire, to produce the ideas, books, buildings, works of art and great individuals that make up our civilisation.The author takes us from Iona in the ninth century to France in the twelfth, from Florence to Urbino, from Germany to Rome, England, Holland and America. Against these historical backgrounds he sketches an extraordinary cast of characters -- the men and women who gave new energy to civilisation and expanded our understanding of the world and of ourselves. He also highlights the works of genius they produced -- in architecture, sculpture and painting, in philosophy, poetry and music, and in science and engineering, from Raphael's School of Athens to the bridges of Brunel.","['non-fiction', 'arts & entertainment', 'economics & politics', 'history']",1,2023-12-22 00:00:00
Civilization and Its Discontents,Sigmund Freud,/books/civilization-and-its-discontents,"It stands as a brilliant summary of the views on culture from a psychoanalytic perspective that he had been developing since the turn of the century. It is both witness and tribute to the late theory of mindâthe so-called structural theory, with its stress on aggression, indeed the death drive, as the pitiless adversary of eros.âCivilization and Its Discontents is one of the last of Freud's books, written in the decade before his death and first published in German in 1929. In it he states his views on the broad question of man's place in the world, a place Freud defines in terms of ceaseless conflict between the individual's quest for freedom and society's demand for conformity.Freud's theme is that what works for civilization doesn't necessarily work for man. Man, by nature aggressive and egotistical, seeks self-satisfaction. But culture inhibits his instinctual drives. The result is a pervasive and familiar guilt.Of the various English translations of Freud's major works to appear in his lifetime, only one was authorized by Freud himself: The Standard Edition of the Complete Psychological Works of Sigmund Freud under the general editorship of James Strachey.Freud approved the overall editorial plan, specific renderings of key words and phrases, and the addition of valuable notes, from bibliographical and explanatory. Many of the translations were done by Strachey himself; the rest were prepared under his supervision. The result was to place the Standard Edition in a position of unquestioned supremacy over all other existing versions.","['non-fiction', 'psychology', 'philosophy']",1,2020-10-24 00:00:00

Clear and Simple as the Truth,Francis-NoÃ«l Thomas & Mark Turner,/books/clear-and-simple-as-the-truth,"For more than a decade, Clear and Simple as the Truth has guided readers to consider style not as an elegant accessory of effective prose but as its very heart. Francis-NoÃ«l Thomas and Mark Turner present writing as an intellectual activity, not a passive application of verbal skills. In classic style, the motive is truth, the purpose is presentation, the reader and writer are intellectual equals, and the occasion is informal. This general style of presentation is at home everywhere, from business memos to personal letters and from magazine articles to student essays. Everyone talks about style, but no one explains it. The authors of this book do; and in doing so, they provoke the reader to consider style, not as an elegant accessory of effective prose, but as its very heart.At a time when writing skills have virtually disappeared, what can be done? If only people learned the principles of verbal correctness, the essential rules, wouldn't good prose simply fall into place? Thomas and Turner say no. Attending to rules of grammar, sense, and sentence structure will no more lead to effective prose than knowing the mechanics of a golf swing will lead to a hole-in-one. Furthermore, ten-step programs to better writing exacerbate the problem by failing to recognize, as Thomas and Turner point out, that there are many styles with different standards.The book is divided into four parts. The first, ""Principles of Classic Style,"" defines the style and contrasts it with a number of others. ""The Museum"" is a guided tour through examples of writing, both exquisite and execrable. ""The Studio,"" new to this edition, presents a series of structured exercises. Finally, ""Further Readings in Classic Prose"" offers a list of additional examples drawn from a range of times, places, and subjects. A companion website, classicprose.com, offers supplementary examples, exhibits, and commentary, and features a selection of pieces written by students in courses that used Clear and Simple as the Truth as a textbook.","['non-fiction', 'design', 'arts & entertainment']",1,2023-12-22 00:00:00
"Clearer, Closer, Better",Emily Balcetis,/books/clearer-closer-better,"Successful people literally see the world differently. Now an award-winning scientist explains how anyone can leverage this ""perception gap"" to their advantage.When it comes to setting and meeting goals, we may see--quite literally--our plans, our progress, and our potential in the wrong ways. We perceive ourselves as being closer to or further from the end than we may actually be depending on our frame of reference. We handicap ourselves by looking too often at the big picture and at other times too long at the fine detail. But as award-winning social psychologist Emily Balcetis explains, there is great power in these misperceptions. We can learn to leverage perceptual illusions if we know when and how to use them to our advantage.Drawing on her own rigorous research and cutting-edge discoveries in vision science, cognitive research, and motivational psychology, Balcetis offers unique accounts of the perceptual habits, routines, and practices that successful people use to set and meet their ambitions. Through case studies of entrepreneurs, athletes, artists, and celebrities--as well as her own colorful experience of trying to set and reach a goal--she brings to life four powerful yet largely untapped visual tactics that can be applied according to the situation.","['non-fiction', 'self improvement', 'business & management']",1,2020-10-24 00:00:00

Still, she is keenly aware that body and soul are not mechanical: desire, love, and the need to communicate face to face don't easily fit into lines of code or clicks in a Web browser. At every turn, she finds she cannot ignore the social and philosophical repercussions of her work.

Cloud Atlas,David Mitchell,/books/cloud-atlas,"A postmodern visionary who is also a master of styles of genres, David Mitchell combines flat-out adventure, a Nabokovian lore of puzzles, a keen eye for character, and a taste for mind-bending philosophical and scientific speculation in the tradition of Umberto Eco, Haruki Murakami, and Philip K. Dick. The result is brilliantly original fiction as profound as it is playful. Now in his new novel, David Mitchell explores with daring artistry fundamental questions of reality and identity.âCloud Atlas begins in 1850 with Adam Ewing, an American notary voyaging from the Chatham Isles to his home in California. Along the way, Ewing is befriended by a physician, Dr. Goose, who begins to treat him for a rare species of brain parasite. . . .Abruptly, the action jumps to Belgium in 1931, where Robert Frobisher, a disinherited bisexual composer, contrives his way into the household of an infirm maestro who has a beguiling wife and a nubile daughter. . . . From there we jump to the West Coast in the 1970s and a troubled reporter named Luisa Rey, who stumbles upon a web of corporate greed and murder that threatens to claim her life. . . . And onward, with dazzling virtuosity, to an inglorious present-day England; to a Korean superstate of the near future where neocapitalism has run amok; and, finally, to a postapocalyptic Iron Age Hawaii in the last days of history.But the story doesnât end even there. The narrative then boomerangs back through centuries and space, returning by the same route, in reverse, to its starting point. Along the way, Mitchell reveals how his disparate characters connect, how their fates intertwine, and how their souls drift across time like clouds across the sky.As wild as a videogame, as mysterious as a Zen koan, Cloud Atlas is an unforgettable tour de force that, like its incomparable author, has transcended its cult classic status to become a worldwide phenomenon.",['fiction'],6,2023-12-22 00:00:00

Coach Wooden and Me,Kareem Abdul-Jabbar,/books/coach-wooden-and-me,"Former NBA star and Presidential Medal of Freedom recipient Kareem Abdul-Jabbar explores his 50-year friendship with Coach John Wooden, one of the most enduring and meaningful relationships in sports history.When future NBA legend Kareem Abdul-Jabbar was still an 18-year-old high school basketball prospect from New York City named Lew Alcindor, he accepted a scholarship from UCLA largely on the strength of Coach John Wooden's reputation as a winner. It turned out to be the right choice, as Alcindor and his teammates won an unprecedented three NCAA championship titles. But it also marked the beginning of one of the most extraordinary and enduring friendships in the history of sports. In COACH WOODEN AND ME, Abdul-Jabbar reveals the inspirational story of how his bond with John Wooden evolved from a history-making coach-player mentorship into a deep and genuine friendship that transcended sports, shaped the course of both men's lives, and lasted for half a century.COACH WOODEN AND ME is a stirring tribute to the subtle but profound influence that Wooden had on Kareem as a player, and then as a person, as they began to share their cultural, religious, and family values while facing some of life's biggest obstacles. From his first day of practice, when the players were taught the importance of putting on their athletic socks properly; to gradually absorbing the sublime wisdom of Coach Wooden's now famous ""Pyramid of Success""; to learning to cope with the ugly racism that confronted black athletes during the turbulent Civil Rights era as well as losing loved ones, Abdul-Jabbar fondly recalls how Coach Wooden's fatherly guidance not only paved the way for his unmatched professional success but also made possible a lifetime of personal fulfillment.Full of intimate, never-before-published details and delivered with the warmth and erudition of a grateful student who has learned his lessons well, COACH WOODEN AND ME is at once a celebration of the unique philosophical outlook of college basketball's most storied coach and a moving testament to the all-conquering power of friendship.","['non-fiction', 'health & fitness', 'biographies & memoirs', 'history']",1,2020-04-06 00:00:00

Collapse,Jared Diamond,/books/collapse,"In Jared Diamondâs follow-up to the Pulitzer-Prize winning Guns, Germs and Steel, the author explores how climate change, the population explosion and political discord create the conditions for the collapse of civilization. Diamond is also the author of Upheaval: Turning Points for Nations in Crisis.Environmental damage, climate change, globalization, rapid population growth, and unwise political choices were all factors in the demise of societies around the world, but some found solutions and persisted.

Collected Essays,James Baldwin,/books/collected-essays,"James Baldwin was a uniquely prophetic voice in American letters. His brilliant and provocative essays made him the literary voice of the Civil Rights Era, and they continue to speak with powerful urgency to us today, whether in the swirling debate over the Black Lives Matter movement or in the words of Raoul Peck's documentary ""I Am Not Your Negro."" Edited by Nobel laureate Toni Morrison, the Library of America's Collected Essays is the most comprehensive gathering of Baldwin's nonfiction ever published.With burning passion and jabbing, epigrammatic wit, Baldwin fearlessly articulated issues of race and democracy and American identity in such famous essays as ""The Harlem Ghetto,"" ""Everybody's Protest Novel,"" ""Many Thousands Gone,"" and ""Stranger in the Village."" Here are the complete texts of his early landmark collections, Notes of a Native Son (1955) and Nobody Knows My Name (1961), which established him as an essential intellectual voice of his time, fusing in unique fashion the personal, the literary, and the political. ""One writes,"" he stated, ""out of one thing onlyâone's own experience. Everything depends on how relentlessly one forces from this experience the last drop, sweet or bitter, it can possibly give."" With singular eloquence and unblinking sharpness of observation he lived up to his credo: ""I want to be an honest man and a good writer.""The classic The Fire Next Time (1963), perhaps the most influential of his writings, is his most penetrating analysis of America's racial divide and an impassioned call to ""end the racial nightmare...and change the history of the world."" The later volumes No Name in the Street (1972) and The Devil Finds Work (1976) chart his continuing response to the social and political turbulence of his era and include his remarkable works of film criticism. A further 36 essaysânine of them previously uncollectedâinclude some of Baldwin's earliest published writings, as well as revealing later insights into the language of Shakespeare, the poetry of Langston Hughes, and the music of Earl Hines.","['non-fiction', 'arts & entertainment', 'biographies & memoirs']",1,2023-12-22 00:00:00

Wise safeties, brooding linebackers, high-strung cornerbacks, enthusiastic rookies, and a well-read nose tackle-they make up a strange and complex family. Dawidoff makes an emblematic NFL season come alive for fans and nonfans alike in a book about football that will forever change the way people watch and think about the sport.","['non-fiction', 'health & fitness']",1,2023-12-22 00:00:00

Colossus,Jack Beatty,/books/colossus,"Big business has been the lever of big change over time in American life, change in economy, society, politics, and the envelope of existence--in work, mores, language, consciousness, and the pace and bite of time. Such is the pattern revealed by this historical mosaic.--From the PrefaceWeaving historical source material with his own incisive analysis, Jack Beatty traces the rise of the American corporation, from its beginnings in the 17th century through today, illustrating how it has come to loom colossus-like over the economy, society, culture, and politics. Through an imaginative selection of readings made up of historical and contemporary documents, opinion pieces, reportage, biographies, company histories, and scenes from literature, all introduced and explicated by Beatty, Colossus makes a convincing case that it is the American corporation that has been, for good and ill, the primary maker and manager of change in modern America. In this anthology, readers are shown how a developing ""business civilization"" has affected domestic life in America, how labor disputes have embodied a struggle between freedom and fraternity, how corporate leaders have faced the recurring dilemma of balancing fiduciary with social responsibility, and how Silicon Valley and Wall Street have come to dwarf Capitol Hill in pervasiveness of influence. From the slave trade and the transcontinental railroad to the software giants and the multimedia conglomerates, Colossus reveals how the corporation emerged as the foundation of representative government in the United States, as the builder of the young nation's public works, as the conqueror of American space, and as the inexhaustible engine of economic growth from the Civil War to today. At the same time, Colossus gives perspective to the century-old debate over the corporation's place in the good society.A saga of freedom and domination, success and failure, creativity and conformity, entrepreneurship and monopoly, high purpose and low practice, Colossus is a major historical achievement.","['non-fiction', 'business & management', 'economics & politics', 'history']",1,2023-12-22 00:00:00
Columbine,Dave Cullen,/books/columbine,"""The tragedies keep coming. As we reel from the latest horror . . . "" So begins a new epilogue, illustrating how Columbine became the template for nearly two decades of ""spectacle murders."" It is a false script, seized upon by a generation of new killers. In the wake of Newtown, Aurora, and Virginia Tech, the imperative to understand the crime that sparked this plague grows more urgent every year.What really happened April 20, 1999? The horror left an indelible stamp on the American psyche, but most of what we ""know"" is wrong. It wasn't about jocks, Goths, or the Trench Coat Mafia. Dave Cullen was one of the first reporters on scene, and spent ten years on this book-widely recognized as the definitive account. With a keen investigative eye and psychological acumen, he draws on mountains of evidence, insight from the world's leading forensic psychologists, and the killers' own words and drawings-several reproduced in a new appendix. Cullen paints raw portraits of two polar opposite killers. They contrast starkly with the flashes of resilience and redemption among the survivors.","['non-fiction', 'history']",1,2020-10-24 00:00:00

But it wasnât always roses for Pete. Growing up, Pete was raised an evangelical Christian, but his religion taught him that being âbadââsmoking, drinking, having doubts or premarital sexâwould get him sent to an eternity in hell. So, terrified of the God he loved, Pete devoted his life to being âgood,â even marrying his first girlfriend at the age of twenty-two only to discover a few years later he was being cheated on. Thanks for nothing, God.Peteâs failed attempt at a picture-perfect life forced him to reexamine his beliefs, but neither atheism, nor Christianity, nor copious bottles of Yellow Tail led him to enlightenment. Pete longed for a model of faith that served him and his newfound uncertainties about the universe, so he embarked on a soul-seeking journey that continues to this day. Through encounters with mind-altering substances, honing his craft in front of thousands of his comedy fans, and spending time with savants like Ram Dass, Pete forged a new lifeâboth spiritually and personally.Beautifully written and often completely hilariousâimagine Dassâs Be Here Now if penned by one of the funniest people aliveâComedy Sex God reveals a man at the top of his game and a seeker in search of the deeper meanings of life, love, and comedy.","['non-fiction', 'biographies & memoirs', 'spirituality & religion']",1,2020-09-27 00:00:00
Coming Through Slaughter,Michael Ondaatje,/books/coming-through-slaughter,"At the turn of the century, the Storyville district of New Orleans had some 2,000 prostitutes, 70 professional gamblers, and 30 piano players. It had only one man who played the cornet like Buddy Bolden. By day he cut hair and purveyed gossip at N. Joseph's Shaving Parlor. At night he played jazz as though unleashing wild animals in a crowded room. At the age of thirty-one, Buddy Bolden went mad. From these sparse facts Michael Ondaatje has created a haunting, lushly atmospheric novel about one of jazz's legendary pioneers and martyrs. Obsessed with death, addicted to whiskey, and self-destructively in love with two women, Buddy Bolden embodies all the dire claims that music places on its acolytes.

Command and Control,Eric Schlosser,/books/command-and-control,"A myth-shattering exposÃ© of Americaâs nuclear weapons.Famed investigative journalist Eric Schlosser digs deep to uncover secrets about the management of Americaâs nuclear arsenal. A groundbreaking account of accidents, near misses, extraordinary heroism, and technological breakthroughs, Command and Control explores the dilemma that has existed since the dawn of the nuclear age: How do you deploy weapons of mass destruction without being destroyed by them? That question has never been resolvedâand Schlosser reveals how the combination of human fallibility and technological complexity still poses a grave risk to mankind. While the harms of global warming increasingly dominate the news, the equally dangerous yet more immediate threat of nuclear weapons has been largely forgotten.Written with the vibrancy of a first-rate thriller, Command and Control interweaves the minute-by-minute story of an accident at a nuclear missile silo in rural Arkansas with a historical narrative that spans more than fifty years. It depicts the urgent effort by American scientists, policy makers, and military officers to ensure that nuclear weapons canât be stolen, sabotaged, used without permission, or detonated inadvertently. Schlosser also looks at the Cold War from a new perspective, offering history from the ground up, telling the stories of bomber pilots, missile commanders, maintenance crews, and other ordinary servicemen who risked their lives to avert a nuclear holocaust. At the heart of the book lies the struggle, amid the rolling hills and small farms of Damascus, Arkansas, to prevent the explosion of a ballistic missile carrying the most powerful nuclear warhead ever built by the United States.Drawing on recently declassified documents and interviews with people who designed and routinely handled nuclear weapons, Command and Control takes readers into a terrifying but fascinating world that, until now, has been largely hidden from view. Through the details of a single accident, Schlosser illustrates how an unlikely event can become unavoidable, how small risks can have terrible consequences, and how the most brilliant minds in the nation can only provide us with an illusion of control. Audacious, gripping, and unforgettable, Command and Control is a tour de force of investigative journalism, an eye-opening look at the dangers of Americaâs nuclear age.","['non-fiction', 'history', 'economics & politics', 'science & nature']",1,2023-12-22 00:00:00
Committed,Elizabeth Gilbert,/books/committed,"At the end of her bestselling memoir Eat, Pray, Love, Elizabeth Gilbert fell in love with Felipe, a Brazilian-born man of Australian citizenship who'd been living in Indonesia when they met. Resettling in America, the couple swore eternal fidelity to each other, but also swore to never, ever, under any circumstances get legally married. (Both were survivors of previous bad divorces. Enough said.) But providence intervened one day in the form of the United States government, which-after unexpectedly detaining Felipe at an American border crossing-gave the couple a choice: they could either get married, or Felipe would never be allowed to enter the country again.Having been effectively sentenced to wed, Gilbert tackled her fears of marriage by delving into this topic completely, trying with all her might to discover through historical research, interviews, and much personal reflection what this stubbornly enduring old institution actually is. Told with Gilbert's trademark wit, intelligence and compassion, Committed attempts to ""turn on all the lights"" when it comes to matrimony, frankly examining questions of compatibility, infatuation, fidelity, family tradition, social expectations, divorce risks and humbling responsibilities. Gilbert's memoir is ultimately a clear-eyed celebration of love with all the complexity and consequence that real love, in the real world, actually entails.","['non-fiction', 'biographies & memoirs']",2,2020-10-24 00:00:00

He had no notion that more than thirty years later, after serving under eleven CIA directors and seven presidents, he would become a notorious public figureâa symbol and a victim of the toxic winds swirling in post-9/11 Washington. From serving as the point person answering for the Iran-contra scandal to approving the rules that govern waterboarding and other âenhanced interrogation techniques,â John Rizzo witnessed and participated in virtually all of the significant operations of the CIAâs modern history.In Company Man, Rizzo charts the CIAâs evolution from shadowy entity to an organization exposed to new laws, rules, and a seemingly neverending string of public controversies. Rizzo offers a direct window into the CIA in the years after the 9/11 attacks, when he served as the agencyâs top lawyer, with oversight of actions that remain the subject of intense debate today. In Company Man, Rizzo is the first CIA official to ever describe what âblack sitesâ look like from the inside and he provides the most comprehensive account ever written of the âtorture tapeâ fiasco surrounding the interrogation of Al Qaeda suspect Abu Zubaydah and the birth, growth, and death of the enhanced interrogation program.Spanning more than three decades, Company Man is the most authoritative insider account of the CIA ever writtenâa groundbreaking, timely, and remarkably candid history of American intelligence.","['non-fiction', 'history', 'biographies & memoirs']",1,2023-12-22 00:00:00

Competing Against Time,Jr. George Stalk & Thomas M. Hout,/books/competing-against-time,"Today, time is the cutting edge. In fact, as a strategic weapon, contend George Stalk, Jr., and Thomas M. Hout, time is the equivalent of money, productivity, quality, even innovation. In this path-breaking book based upon ten years of research, the authors argue that the ways leading companies manage timeâ in production, in new product development, and in sales and distributionâ represent the most powerful new sources of competitive advantage.With many detailed examples from companies that have put time-based strategies in place, such as Federal Express, Ford, Milliken, Honda, Deere, Toyota, Sun Microsystems, Wal-Mart, Citicorp, Harley-Davidson, and Mitsubishi, the authors describe exactly how reducing elapsed time can make the critical difference between success and failure. Give customers what they want when they want it, or the competition will. Time-based companies are offering greater varieties of products and services, at lower costs, and with quicker delivery times than their more pedestrian competitors.Moreover, the authors show that by refocusing their organizations on responsiveness, companies are discovering that long-held assumptions about the behavior of costs and customers are not true: Costs do not increase when lead times are reduced; they decline. Costs do not increase with greater investment in quality; they decrease. Costs do not go up when product variety is increased and response time is decreased; they go down. And contrary to a commonly held belief that customer demand would be only marginally improved by expanded product choice and better responsiveness, the authors show that the actual results have been an explosion in the demand for the product or service of a time-sensitive competitor, in most cases catapulting it into the most profitable segments of its markets.","['non-fiction', 'business & management']",1,2023-12-22 00:00:00

Complexity,M. Mitchell Waldrop,/books/complexity-m-mitchell-waldrop,"Why did the stock market crash more than 500 points on a single Monday in 1987? Why do ancient species often remain stable in the fossil record for millions of years and then suddenly disappear? In a world where nice guys often finish last, why do humans value trust and cooperation? At first glance these questions don't appear to have anything in common, but in fact every one of these statements refers to a complex system. The science of complexity studies how single elements, such as a species or a stock, spontaneously organize into complicated structures like ecosystems and economies; stars become galaxies, and snowflakes avalanches almost as if these systems were obeying a hidden yearning for order.Drawing from diverse fields, scientific luminaries such as Nobel Laureates Murray Gell-Mann and Kenneth Arrow are studying complexity at a think tank called The Santa Fe Institute.

Confessions of the Pricing Man,Hermann Simon,/books/confessions-of-the-pricing-man,"The world's foremost expert on pricing strategy shows how this mysterious process works and how to maximize value through pricing to company and customer.âIn all walks of life, we constantly make decisions about whether something is worth our money or our time, or try to convince others to part with their money or their time. Price is the place where value and money meet. From the global release of the latest electronic gadget to the bewildering gyrations of oil futures to markdowns at the bargain store, price is the most powerful and pervasive economic force in our day-to-day lives and one of the least understood.The recipe for successful pricing often sounds like an exotic cocktail, with equal parts psychology, economics, strategy, tools and incentives stirred up together, usually with just enough math to sour the taste. That leads managers to water down the drink with hunches and rules of thumb, or leave out the parts with which they don t feel comfortable. While this makes for a sweeter drink, it often lacks the punch to have an impact on the customer or on the business.","['non-fiction', 'business & management', 'economics & politics', 'psychology']",2,2023-12-22 00:00:00

Suskind moves from the frenzied trading floors of lower Manhattan to the power corridors inside the Beltway and introduces a larger than life cast of politicians and advisors, titans of high finance, reformers, lobbyists, and others who faced a crisis unlike anything they had ever imagined.Based on hundreds of hours of interviews and exhaustive research, filled with piercing insight and startling disclosures, Confidence Men goes beyond the headlines and previous accounts, bringing into focus the unprecedented struggle between the nation's two capitals; New York and Washington, one of private gain, the other of public purpose;that continues to divide and roil America.","['non-fiction', 'history', 'economics & politics']",1,2023-12-22 00:00:00

Piero Gleijeses's fast-paced narrative takes the reader from Cuba's first steps to assist Algerian rebels fighting France in 1961, to the secret war between Havana and Washington in Zaire in 1964-65--where 100 Cubans led by Che Guevara clashed with 1,000 mercenaries controlled by the CIA--and, finally, to the dramatic dispatch of 30,000 Cubans to Angola in 1975-76, which stopped the South African advance on Luanda and doomed Henry Kissinger's major covert operation there.Based on unprecedented archival research and firsthand interviews in virtually all of the countries involved--Gleijeses was even able to gain extensive access to closed Cuban archives--this comprehensive and balanced work sheds new light on U.S. foreign policy and CIA covert operations. It revolutionizes our view of Cuba's international role, challenges conventional U.S. beliefs about the influence of the Soviet Union in directing Cuba's actions in Africa, and provides, for the first time ever, a look from the inside at Cuba's foreign policy during the Cold War.","['non-fiction', 'history', 'economics & politics']",1,2020-10-24 00:00:00

Rather than having occasional, episodic interactions--where customers realize they have an unmet need and then look for ways to fill it--firms are striving to be continuously connected to their customers, providing services and products as the needs arise, even before customers become aware of them.Firms such as Nike, Disney, Progressive Insurance, McGraw-Hill Higher Education, Medtronic, Hewlett-Packard, and Tesco are developing and competing on connected strategies: creating superior customer experiences through connectivity while simultaneously driving dramatic improvements in operational efficiencies and reshaping their industries.Strategy and operations experts Nicolaj Siggelkow and Christian Terwiesch reveal the emergence of connected strategies across a broad array of industries and show how these strategies work, how they eliminate the trade-off between superior customer experience and low cost, and how companies can formulate, design, and implement them. In showing how to create a connected strategy, the authors reveal the four pathways--respond-to-desire, curated offerings, coaching, and automatic execution--for turning occasional, episodic interactions into continuous relationships. Siggelkow and Terwiesch show you how to:Reshape the connections between customers, suppliers, and your firm Create the right revenue model Make the best technology choices to support your strategyIntegrating rich examples, how-to advice, and tools in the form of ""workshop chapters"" throughout, this book is the ultimate resource for creating connected relationships with your customers and redefining the connections in your industry.","['non-fiction', 'business & management']",2,2023-12-22 00:00:00

Conquer Type 2 Diabetes,Ellen Davis & Keith Runyan,/books/conquer-type-2-diabetes,"Type 2 diabetes is a modern disease of carbohydrate intolerance, meaning your body isnât able to process carbohydrate (sugars and starches) normally. Consuming these foods results in high blood sugar, and over time, diabetic complications. Before the invention of insulin in the 1920s, physicians advised diabetics to avoid eating carbohydrates because of this intolerance. In contrast, modern advice is to eat carbohydrates and treat the resulting high blood sugar with medications and insulin. This âeat carb and take medicineâ method increases the cost of diabetic care and does nothing to resolve the underlying disease and progression.The logical solution is to follow a low-carb ketogenic diet because it treats type 2 diabetes at the root cause. Avoiding carbs while enjoying foods rich in healthy fats and protein stabilizes blood sugar and reduces and in some cases, eliminates the need for diabetic medications. Conquer Type 2 Diabetes with a Ketogenic Diet has all the information you need to successfully take control of your diabetes. In addition to clear explanations of the science, this book includes personal success stories, information on blood sugar monitoring and insulin therapy, the foods to eat and to avoid, cooking tips, how to get started and personalize the diet, medication interactions and more.","['non-fiction', 'science & nature', 'health & fitness']",1,2023-12-22 00:00:00

"Conquest, Tribute and Trade",Howard J. Erlichman,/books/conquest-tribute-and-trade,"This new edition of Conquest, Tribute and Trade: How the Quest for Precious Metals Gave Birth to Globalization (2016) has been revised to improve the clarity of the text, maps and end-notes. The book itself attempts to explain the birth of globalization in a new way and address three interrelated developments which have been under-analyzed, pigeon-holed or even ignored.First, how and why the discovery, extraction and distribution of precious metals -- gold, copper and, above all, silver -- enabled the closely-related Portuguese, Spanish and Dutch to supersede the great Italian city-states, neutralize the Ottomans and overturn centuries of Muslim domination in Africa and Asia during the course of the sixteenth century.Second, how and why the Europeans squandered much of the metallic wealth of Africa, the Americas and the Far East on inconclusive military affairs, exploited (and often destroyed) indigenous societies across the globe and left behind a wake of east-west animosities which has lasted for five centuries.And third, how and why a breakaway portion of the Spanish Netherlands, the Dutch Republic, co-opted many of the achievements of the Iberians, gained control of increasingly large stocks of precious metals between 1590 and 1609 and served as a commercial âbridgeâ to the later British Empire (and the United States).The book is intended to serve as a very modern tale of business and economic history which just happens to be set in the sixteenth century. The narrative details the central, driving, multidimensional (and almost unbelievable) roles played by a handful of mines and metallurgical works; the larger-than-life characters who discovered, financed or exploited these mineral resources and created the worldâs first multinational corporations; and the spectacular squander, measured in financial and human terms, which resulted from a never-ending series of military campaigns and helped to shift the balance of global power to (and from) a succession of would-be empires.Conquest, Tribute and Trade also helps to explain how and why Europeâs remarkable geographical conquests in this one century, the sixteenth, laid a foundation of Western dominance (and animosities) which has lasted for roughly five hundred years, introduced patterns of economic development which are being repeated in the twenty-first and generated a host of lessons to be studied by anyone interested in the processes through which commercial empires are won and lost.","['non-fiction', 'economics & politics', 'history']",1,2023-12-22 00:00:00
Conscious,Annaka Harris,/books/conscious,"As concise and enlightening as Seven Brief Lessons on Physics and Astrophysics for People in a Hurry, this mind-expanding dive into the mystery of consciousness is an illuminating meditation on the self, free will, and felt experience.What is consciousness? How does it arise? And why does it exist? We take our experience of being in the world for granted. But the very existence of consciousness raises profound questions: Why would any collection of matter in the universe be conscious? How are we able to think about this? And why should we?In this wonderfully accessible book, Annaka Harris guides us through the evolving definitions, philosophies, and scientific findings that probe our limited understanding of consciousness. Where does it reside, and what gives rise to it? Could it be an illusion, or a universal property of all matter? As we try to understand consciousness, we must grapple with how to define it and, in the age of artificial intelligence, who or what might possess it. Conscious offers lively and challenging arguments that alter our ideas about consciousnessâallowing us to think freely about it for ourselves, if indeed we can.","['non-fiction', 'philosophy', 'science & nature', 'psychology']",2,2020-10-24 00:00:00

Topics include vision and attention, theories of self, experiments on action and awareness, altered states of consciousness, and the effects of brain damage and drugs.This lively, engaging, and authoritative book provides a clear overview of the subject that combines the perspectives of philosophy, psychology, and neuroscience--and serves as a much-needed launch pad for further exploration of this complicated and unsolved issue.","['non-fiction', 'philosophy', 'science & nature']",1,2023-12-22 00:00:00

Conspiracy,Ryan Holiday,/books/conspiracy,"A stunning story about how power works in the modern age--the book the New York Times called ""one helluva page-turner"" and The Sunday Times of London celebrated as ""riveting...an astonishing modern media conspiracy that is a fantastic read."" Pick up the book everyone is talking about.In 2007, a short blogpost on Valleywag, the Silicon Valley-vertical of Gawker Media, outed PayPal founder and billionaire investor Peter Thiel as gay. Thiel's sexuality had been known to close friends and family, but he didn't consider himself a public figure, and believed the information was private.This post would be the casus belli for a meticulously plotted conspiracy that would end nearly a decade later with a $140 million dollar judgment against Gawker, its bankruptcy and with Nick Denton, Gawker's CEO and founder, out of a job. Only later would the world learn that Gawker's demise was not incidental--it had been masterminded by Thiel.For years, Thiel had searched endlessly for a solution to what he'd come to call the ""Gawker Problem."" When an unmarked envelope delivered an illegally recorded sex tape of Hogan with his best friend's wife, Gawker had seen the chance for millions of pageviews and to say the things that others were afraid to say. Thiel saw their publication of the tape as the opportunity he was looking for. He would come to pit Hogan against Gawker in a multi-year proxy war through the Florida legal system, while Gawker remained confidently convinced they would prevail as they had over so many other lawsuit--until it was too late.The verdict would stun the world and so would Peter's ultimate unmasking as the man who had set it all in motion. Why had he done this? How had no one discovered it? What would this mean--for the First Amendment? For privacy? For culture?In Holiday's masterful telling of this nearly unbelievable conspiracy, informed by interviews with all the key players, this case transcends the narrative of how one billionaire took down a media empire or the current state of the free press. It's a study in power, strategy, and one of the most wildly ambitious--and successful--secret plots in recent memory.Some will cheer Gawker's destruction and others will lament it, but after reading these pages--and seeing the access the author was given--no one will deny that there is something ruthless and brilliant about Peter Thiel's shocking attempt to shake up the world.","['non-fiction', 'business & management']",5,2023-12-22 00:00:00

And the result was a series of witty, provocative, and profound books that have changed the lives of readers around the world. Here in one handsome volume are the second two books in the Conversations with God series.In Conversations with God 2, Neale Donald Walsch and God continue their discussion and move on to larger topics than the personal issues addressed in Conversations with God 1. The pair discusses time, space, politics, and even kinky sex. It is an honest look at some of the broad issues important to all of us on the planet.In Conversations with God 3, final book of the original three-book series, ""universal truths of the highest order, and the challenges and opportunities of the soul."" In this volume, the dialogue expands to include more about the nature of God, about love and fear, about who we are and who we may become. Here is also a profound dialogue about the culture, philosophy, and spirituality of highly evolved beings (some of whom we presently call ""aliens"" or ""ETs"") in other realms of the universe and how they have learned to view life, love and the pursuit of happiness.","['non-fiction', 'spirituality & religion', 'philosophy', 'self improvement']",1,2023-12-22 00:00:00
Conversations with Major Dick Winters,Cole C.

Now comes the story of his last years as witnessed and experienced by his good friend Cole C. Kingseed. Kingseed shares the formative experiences that made Winters such an effective leader. He addresses Wintersâs experiences and leadership during the war, his intense, unbreakable devotion to his men, his search for peace both without and within after the war, and how fame forced him to make adjustments to an international audience of well-wishers and admirers, even as he attempted to leave a lasting legacy before joining his fallen comrades. Following Wintersâs death on January 2, 2011, the outpouring of grief and adulation for one of this nationâs preeminent leaders of character, courage, and competence showed just how much of an impact Dick Winters left on the world.","['non-fiction', 'biographies & memoirs', 'history']",1,2023-12-22 00:00:00
Convict Conditioning,Paul Wade,/books/convict-conditioning,"How to Train As If Your VERY LIFE Depended on Your Degree of REAL Strength, Power and ToughnessMost physical training systems are designed for the domesticated human animal. That is to say, for us humans who live lives of such relative security that we cultivate our strength and power more out of pride and for a sense of accomplishment than out of an absolute need to survive in the wild. The professional athlete hones his body to function well in a sports event-rather than to emerge safe from a life-or-death struggle. And even those in our military and LEO rely more on the security of their weapons and armor than on their own personal, raw power and brute strength to carry the day.There remains one environment where exuding the necessary degree of authoritative strength and power can mean the difference between life or death: the maximum security prison. In maximum security, the predator preys on the weak like we breathe air. Intimidation is the daily currency. You either become a professional victim or you develop that supreme survival strength that signals the predator to stay at bay.Paul Wade spent 19 years in hell holes like San Quentin, Angola and Marion. He entered this world a gangly, terrorized weakling and he graduated to final freedom, pound-for-pound one of the strongest humans on the planet.Paul Wade dedicated his prison life to the cultivation of that supreme survival strength. And ironically, it is in America's prisons that we can find some of the great, lost secrets of how to get immensely powerful and strong. Paul Wade mined these secrets as if his life depended on it-and of course in many ways it did.Finally free, Paul Wade pays his debt to society-not just with the horrors of his years in the hole-but with the greatest gift he could possibly give us: a priceless set of progressions that can take ANYONE who has the will from abject weakling to strength specimen extraordinaire.","['non-fiction', 'health & fitness']",1,2020-10-16 00:00:00

Cooked,Michael Pollan,/books/cooked,"In Cooked, Michael Pollan explores the previously uncharted territory of his own kitchen. Here, he discovers the enduring power of the four classical elementsâfire, water, air, and earthâto transform the stuff of nature into delicious things to eat and drink. Apprenticing himself to a succession of culinary masters, Pollan learns how to grill with fire, cook with liquid, bake bread, and ferment everything from cheese to beer.Each section of Cooked tracks Pollanâs effort to master a single classic recipe using one of the four elements. A North Carolina barbecue pit master tutors him in the primal magic of fire; a Chez Panisseâtrained cook schools him in the art of braising; a celebrated baker teaches him how air transforms grain and water into a fragrant loaf of bread; and finally, several mad-genius âfermentosâ (a tribe that includes brewers, cheese makers, and all kinds of picklers) reveal how fungi and bacteria can perform the most amazing alchemies of all. The reader learns alongside Pollan, but the lessons move beyond the practical to become an investigation of how cooking involves us in a web of social and ecological relationships. Cooking, above all, connects us.The effects of not cooking are similarly far reaching. Relying upon corporations to process our food means we consume large quantities of fat, sugar, and salt; disrupt an essential link to the natural world; and weaken our relationships with family and friends. In fact, Cooked argues, taking back control of cooking may be the single most important step anyone can take to help make the American food system healthier and more sustainable. Reclaiming cooking as an act of enjoyment and self-reliance, learning to perform the magic of these everyday transformations, opens the door to a more nourishing life.","['non-fiction', 'science & nature', 'health & fitness', 'philosophy']",1,2023-12-22 00:00:00

This book provides a bird's-eye view of the whole terrain--where fears originate, how to understand them, and how to find the courage to face them. In the process, Osho proposes that whenever we are faced with uncertainty and change in our lives, it is actually a cause for celebration. Instead of trying to hang on to the familiar and the known, we can learn to enjoy these situations as opportunities for adventure and for deepening our understanding of ourselves and the world around us.The book begins with an in-depth exploration of the meaning of courage and how it is expressed in the everyday life of the individual. Unlike books that focus on heroic acts of courage in exceptional circumstances, the focus here is on developing the inner courage that enables us to lead authentic and fulfilling lives on a day-to-day basis. This is the courage to change when change is needed, the courage to stand up for our own truth, even against the opinions of others, and the courage to embrace the unknown in spite of our fears-in our relationships, in our careers, or in the ongoing journey of understanding who we are and why we are here.âCourage also features a number of meditation techniques specifically designed by Osho to help people deal with their fears.","['non-fiction', 'philosophy', 'spirituality & religion', 'self improvement', 'psychology']",1,2020-10-24 00:00:00

To be truly cozy, she argues, means learning to identify the innermost truth of yourself and carrying it into the world, no matter your environment.Starting when she was young, Gillies has gradually learned the art and subtle beauty of creating a life where you feel safe, steadied, and at home in the world. From old family recipes and subway rides to jury duty and hospital stays, in Cozy Gillies shows readers that true ease stems not with throw pillows and a candle, but from opportunities to feel that we are part of something bigger than ourselves, and learn to make ourselves at home no matter where we are.Simple choices can make a hectic life or an uncomfortable situation just a little more comfortableâyou just have to know what to do.

Cradle to Cradle,Michael Braungart,/books/cradle-to-cradle,"A manifesto for a radically different philosophy and practice of manufacture and environmentalism.""Reduce, reuse, recycle"" urge environmentalists; in other words, do more with less in order to minimize damage. But as this provocative, visionary book argues, this approach perpetuates a one-way, ""cradle to grave"" manufacturing model that dates to the Industrial Revolution and casts off as much as 90 percent of the materials it uses as waste, much of it toxic. Why not challenge the notion that human industry must inevitably damage the natural world?In fact, why not take nature itself as our model? A tree produces thousands of blossoms in order to create another tree, yet we do not consider its abundance wasteful but safe, beautiful, and highly effective; hence, ""waste equals food"" is the first principle the book sets forth. Products might be designed so that, after their useful life, they provide nourishment for something new-either as ""biological nutrients"" that safely re-enter the environment or as ""technical nutrients"" that circulate within closed-loop industrial cycles, without being ""downcycled"" into low-grade uses (as most ""recyclables"" now are).Elaborating their principles from experience (re)designing everything from carpeting to corporate campuses, William McDonough and Michael Braungart make an exciting and viable case for change.","['non-fiction', 'economics & politics', 'technology', 'business & management']",1,2023-12-22 00:00:00

Through a series of vignettes, Elizabeth Gaskell portrays a community governed by old-fashioned habits and dominated by friendships between women.

Creating the Twentieth Century,Vaclav Smil,/books/creating-the-twentieth-century,"The period between 1867 and 1914 remains the greatest watershed in human history since the emergence of settled agricultural societies: the time when an expansive civilization based on synergy of fuels, science, and technical innovation was born. At its beginnings in the 1870s were dynamite, the telephone, photographic film, and the first light bulbs. Its peak decade - the astonishing 1880s - brought electricity - generating plants, electric motors, steam turbines, the gramophone, cars, aluminum production, air-filled rubber tires, and prestressed concrete. And its post-1900 period saw the first airplanes, tractors, radio signals and plastics, neon lights and assembly line production.This book is a systematic interdisciplinary account of the history of this outpouring of European and American intellect and of its truly epochal consequences. It takes a close look at four fundamental classes of these epoch-making innovations: formation, diffusion, and standardization of electric systems; invention and rapid adoption of internal combustion engines; the unprecedented pace of new chemical syntheses and material substitutions; and the birth of a new information age. These chapters are followed by an evaluation of the lasting impact these advances had on the 20th century, that is, the creation of high-energy societies engaged in mass production aimed at improving standards of living.","['non-fiction', 'science & nature', 'technology', 'history']",1,2023-12-22 00:00:00

Creativity and the Brain,Mario Tokoro,/books/creativity-and-the-brain,"Creativity is a uniquely human ability highly prized and sought after, defining the excellence of individuals, corporations, and nations. In the modern era of global competition, the nurturing of creativity in oneself and others has become a major concern for the general public. Until recently, however, human creativity had been treated as a mysterious process of brain activity, since we had neither tools to measure precisely the brain activities nor the theories to analyze and synthesize creativity.The quick advancement of brain science these days thanks largely to the development of various measurement tools such as EEG, EMG, and fMRI and to new attitudes which view the brain as a system has enabled us to discuss creativity in the context of science. Written in an entertaining manner, the book is a modern primer on the science of creativity and would attract a wide audience from those already versed in cognitive or brain sciences to the layman from the street.","['non-fiction', 'science & nature', 'business & management', 'design', 'psychology']",1,2023-12-22 00:00:00
"Creativity, Inc.",Ed Catmull,/books/creativity-inc,"âWhat does it mean to manage well?ââFrom Ed Catmull, co-founder (with Steve Jobs and John Lasseter) of Pixar Animation Studios, comes an incisive book about creativity in businessâsure to appeal to readers of Daniel Pink, Tom Peters, and Chip and Dan Heath. Creativity, Inc. is a book for managers who want to lead their employees to new heights, a manual for anyone who strives for originality, and the first-ever, all-access trip into the nerve center of Pixar Animationâinto the meetings, postmortems, and âBraintrustâ sessions where some of the most successful films in history are made. It is, at heart, a book about how to build a creative cultureâbut it is also, as Pixar co-founder and president Ed Catmull writes, âan expression of the ideas that I believe make the best in us possible.âFor nearly twenty years, Pixar has dominated the world of animation, producing such beloved films as the Toy Story trilogy, Monsters, Inc., Finding Nemo, The Incredibles, Up, and WALL-E, which have gone on to set box-office records and garner thirty Academy Awards. The joyousness of the storytelling, the inventive plots, the emotional authenticity: In some ways, Pixar movies are an object lesson in what creativity really is. Here, in this book, Catmull reveals the ideals and techniques that have made Pixar so widely admiredâand so profitable.As a young man, Ed Catmull had a dream: to make the first computer-animated movie. He nurtured that dream as a Ph.D. student at the University of Utah, where many computer science pioneers got their start, and then forged a partnership with George Lucas that led, indirectly, to his founding Pixar with Steve Jobs and John Lasseter in 1986. Nine years later, Toy Story was released, changing animation forever. The essential ingredient in that movieâs successâand in the thirteen movies that followedâwas the unique environment that Catmull and his colleagues built at Pixar, based on philosophies that protect the creative process and defy convention.","['non-fiction', 'design', 'business & management', 'biographies & memoirs', 'technology']",12,2023-12-22 00:00:00
Crime and Punishment,Fyodor Dostoyevsky,/books/crime-and-punishment,"The two years before he wrote Crime and Punishment (1866) had been bad ones for Dostoyevsky. His wife and brother had died; the magazine he and his brother had started, Epoch, collapsed under its load of debt; and he was threatened with debtor's prison. With an advance that he managed to wangle for an unwritten novel, he fled to Wiesbaden, hoping to win enough at the roulette table to get himself out of debt. Instead, he lost all his money; he had to pawn his clothes and beg friends for loans to pay his hotel bill and get back to Russia. One of his begging letters went to a magazine editor, asking for an advance on yet another unwritten novel â which he described as Crime and Punishment.One of the supreme masterpieces of world literature, Crime and Punishment catapulted Dostoyevsky to the forefront of Russian writers and into the ranks of the world's greatest novelists. Drawing upon experiences from his own prison days, the author recounts in feverish, compelling tones the story of Raskolnikov, an impoverished student tormented by his own nihilism, and the struggle between good and evil. Believing that he is above the law, and convinced that humanitarian ends justify vile means, he brutally murders an old woman â a pawnbroker whom he regards as ""stupid, ailing, greedyâ¦good for nothing.""Overwhelmed afterwards by feelings of guilt and terror, Raskolnikov confesses to the crime and goes to prison. There he realizes that happiness and redemption can only be achieved through suffering.

Cutting Through Spiritual Materialism,ChÃ¶gyam Trungpa,/books/cutting-through-spiritual-materialism,"This modern spiritual classic highlights a trick we play on ourselves and offers a brighter reality: liberation by letting go of the self rather than working to improve it. The Tibetan meditation master ChÃ¶gyam Trungpa calls attention to the commonest pitfall to which every aspirant on the spiritual path falls prey: what he calls spiritual materialism. ""The problem is that ego can convert anything to its own use,"" he says, ""even spirituality."" The universal tendency is to see spirituality as a process of self-improvementâthe impulse to develop and refine the ego when the ego is, by nature, essentially empty.Trungpa's incisive, compassionate teachings serve to wake us up from these false comforts. Featuring a new foreword by his son and lineage holder, Cutting Through Spiritual Materialism has resonated with students for nearly thirty yearsâand remains as fresh as ever today.","['non-fiction', 'spirituality & religion', 'philosophy', 'self improvement']",1,2023-12-22 00:00:00

"DEC Is Dead, Long Live DEC",Edgar H. Schein,/books/dec-is-dead-long-live-dec,"DEC Is Dead, Long Live DEC tells the 40-year story of the creation, demise, and enduring legacy of one of the pioneering companies of the computer age. Digital Equipment Corporation created the minicomputer, networking, the concept of distributed computing, speech recognition, and other major innovations. It was the number two computer maker behind IBM. Yet it ultimately failed as a business and was sold to Compaq Corporation. What happened?Edgar Schein consulted to DEC throughout its history and so had unparalleled access to all the major players, and an inside view of all the major events. He shows how the unique organizational culture established by DEC's founder, Ken Olsen, gave the company important competitive advantages in its early years, but later became a hindrance and ultimately led to the company's downfall. Schein, Kampas, DeLisi, and Sonduck explain in detail how a particular culture can become so embedded that an organization is unable to adapt to changing circumstances even though it sees the need very clearly.The essential elements of DEC's culture are still visible in many other organizations today, and most former employees are so positive about their days at DEC that they attempt to reproduce its culture in their current work situations. In the era of post-dot.com meltdown, raging debate about companies ""built to last"" vs. ""built to sell,"" and more entrepreneurial startups than ever, the rise and fall of DEC is the ultimate case study.","['non-fiction', 'business & management', 'history']",1,2023-12-22 00:00:00
DMT,Rick Strassman,/books/dmt,"A clinical psychiatrist explores the effects of DMT, one of the most powerful psychedelics known.A behind-the-scenes look at the cutting edge of psychedelic research.Provides a unique scientific explanation for the phenomenon of alien abduction experiences.From 1990 to 1995 Dr. Rick Strassman conducted U.S. Government-approved and funded clinical research at the University of New Mexico in which he injected sixty volunteers with DMT, one of the most powerful psychedelics known. His detailed account of those sessions is an extraordinarily riveting inquiry into the nature of the human mind and the therapeutic potential of psychedelics. DMT, a plant-derived chemical found in the psychedelic Amazon brew, ayahuasca, is also manufactured by the human brain. In Strassman's volunteers, it consistently produced near-death and mystical experiences. Many reported convincing encounters with intelligent nonhuman presences, aliens, angels, and spirits. Nearly all felt that the sessions were among the most profound experiences of their lives.Strassman's research connects DMT with the pineal gland, considered by Hindus to be the site of the seventh chakra and by Rene Descartes to be the seat of the soul. DMT: The Spirit Molecule makes the bold case that DMT, naturally released by the pineal gland, facilitates the soul's movement in and out of the body and is an integral part of the birth and death experiences, as well as the highest states of meditation and even sexual transcendence. Strassman also believes that ""alien abduction experiences"" are brought on by accidental releases of DMT. If used wisely, DMT could trigger a period of remarkable progress in the scientific exploration of the most mystical regions of the human mind and soul.","['non-fiction', 'science & nature', 'spirituality & religion']",3,2023-12-22 00:00:00

Dangerously Sleepy,Alan Derickson,/books/dangerously-sleepy,"Workers in the United States are experiencing sleep deprivation. In today's global economy, an increasing number of workers have multiple jobs, frequently at the same time, with variable hours. Even before the advent of the 24-hour workplace, the relationship between sleep and industry was thorny: sleep is typically portrayed as a liability or a flaw, while perpetual productivity and flexibility are lauded at the price of health and safety.Dangerously Sleepy is the first book to follow the long-standing link between overwork and sleep deprivation from the nineteenth century to now. Alan Derickson, a health and labor historian, examines the cultural and political dynamics that have led to the overvaluation of wakefulness in the United States, as well as its masculinization. Steelworkers dealt with rotating shifts, Pullman porters dealt with ever-changing timetables and constant on-call status, and long-haul truckers contended with the chaos of life on the road since the eighteenth century. The dangers of weariness, on the other hand, were ignored and even glamorized when popular personalities like Thomas Edison and Donald Trump pushed American males to ignore biological needs in the sake of achievement. Resisting sleep became a test of manly strength for employees.This clear history of the wakeful work ethic implies that for millions of Americans, inflexible work schedules have been the primary cause of sleep loss, novel diseases like shift work sleep disorder, and accompanying morbidity and death. Dangerously Sleepy provides historical background for these public health issues.","['non-fiction', 'science & nature', 'economics & politics']",1,2023-12-22 00:00:00

Dare to Lead,BrenÃ© Brown,/books/dare-to-lead,"In her #1 NYT bestsellers, BrenÃ© Brown taught us what it means to dare greatly, rise strong and brave the wilderness. Now, based on new research conducted with leaders, change makers and culture shifters, sheâs showing us how to put those ideas into practice so we can step up and lead.Leadership is not about titles, status and power over people. Leaders are people who hold themselves accountable for recognising the potential in people and ideas, and developing that potential. This is a book for everyone who is ready to choose courage over comfort, make a difference and lead.When we dare to lead, we don't pretend to have the right answers; we stay curious and ask the right questions. We don't see power as finite and hoard it; we know that power becomes infinite when we share it and work to align authority and accountability. We don't avoid difficult conversations and situations; we lean into the vulnerability thatâs necessary to do good work.But daring leadership in a culture that's defined by scarcity, fear and uncertainty requires building courage skills, which are uniquely human. The irony is that we're choosing not to invest in developing the hearts and minds of leaders at the same time we're scrambling to figure out what we have to offer that machines can't do better and faster. What can we do better? Empathy, connection and courage to start.BrenÃ© Brown spent the past two decades researching the emotions that give meaning to our lives. Over the past seven years, she found that leaders in organisations ranging from small entrepreneurial start-ups and family-owned businesses to non-profits, civic organisations and Fortune 50 companies, are asking the same questions:How do you cultivate braver, more daring leaders? And, how do you embed the value of courage in your culture?âDare to Lead answers these questions and gives us actionable strategies and real examples from her new research-based, courage-building programme.BrenÃ© writes, âOne of the most important findings of my career is that courage can be taught, developed and measured. Courage is a collection of four skill sets supported by twenty-eight behaviours. All it requires is a commitment to doing bold work, having tough conversations and showing up with our whole hearts. Easy? No. Choosing courage over comfort is not easy. Worth it? Always. We want to be brave with our lives and work. It's why we're here.â","['non-fiction', 'business & management', 'self improvement']",3,2023-12-22 00:00:00
Daring Greatly,Brene Brown,/books/daring-greatly,"âIt is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; . . . who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly.ââTheodore RooseveltEvery day we experience the uncertainty, risks, and emotional exposure that define what it means to be vulnerable or to dare greatly. Based on twelve years of pioneering research, BrenÃ© Brown PhD, LMSW, dispels the cultural myth that vulnerability is weakness and argues that it is, in truth, our most accurate measure of courage.Brown explains how vulnerability is both the core of difficult emotions like fear, grief, and disappointment, and the birthplace of love, belonging, joy, empathy, innovation, and creativity. She writes: âWhen we shut ourselves off from vulnerability, we distance ourselves from the experiences that bring purpose and meaning to our lives.âDaring Greatly is not about winning or losing. Itâs about courage. In a world where ânever enoughâ dominates and feeling afraid has become second nature, vulnerability is subversive. Uncomfortable. Itâs even a little dangerous at times. And, without question, putting ourselves out there means thereâs a far greater risk of getting criticized or feeling hurt. But when we step back and examine our lives, we will find that nothing is as uncomfortable, dangerous, and hurtful as standing on the outside of our lives looking in and wondering what it would be like if we had the courage to step into the arenaâwhether itâs a new relationship, an important meeting, the creative process, or a difficult family conversation. Daring Greatly is a practice and a powerful new vision for letting ourselves be seen.","['non-fiction', 'self improvement', 'psychology']",5,2023-12-22 00:00:00

Dark Money,Jane Mayer,/books/dark-money,"Why is America living in an age of profound economic inequality? Why, despite the desperate need to address climate change, have even modest environmental efforts been defeated again and again? Why have protections for employees been decimated? Why do hedge-fund billionaires pay a far lower tax rate than middle-class workers?The conventional answer is that a popular uprising against âbig governmentâ led to the ascendancy of a broad-based conservative movement. But as Jane Mayer shows in this powerful, meticulously reported history, a network of exceedingly wealthy people with extreme libertarian views bankrolled a systematic, step-by-step plan to fundamentally alter the American political system.The network has brought together some of the richest people on the planet. Their core beliefsâthat taxes are a form of tyranny; that government oversight of business is an assault on freedomâare sincerely held. But these beliefs also advance their personal and corporate interests: Many of their companies have run afoul of federal pollution, worker safety, securities, and tax laws.The chief figures in the network are Charles and David Koch, whose father made his fortune in part by building oil refineries in Stalinâs Russia and Hitlerâs Germany. The patriarch later was a founding member of the John Birch Society, whose politics were so radical it believed Dwight Eisenhower was a communist. The brothers were schooled in a political philosophy that asserted the only role of government is to provide security and to enforce property rights.When libertarian ideas proved decidedly unpopular with voters, the Koch brothers and their allies chose another path. If they pooled their vast resources, they could fund an interlocking array of organizations that could work in tandem to influence and ultimately control academic institutions, think tanks, the courts, statehouses, Congress, and, they hoped, the presidency. Richard Mellon Scaife, the mercurial heir to banking and oil fortunes, had the brilliant insight that most of their political activities could be written off as tax-deductible âphilanthropy.âThese organizations were given innocuous names such as Americans for Prosperity. Funding sources were hidden whenever possible. This process reached its apotheosis with the allegedly populist Tea Party movement, abetted mightily by the Citizens United decisionâa case conceived of by legal advocates funded by the network.The political operatives the network employs are disciplined, smart, and at times ruthless. Mayer documents instances in which people affiliated with these groups hired private detectives to impugn whistle-blowers, journalists, and even government investigators. And their efforts have been remarkably successful. Libertarian views on taxes and regulation, once far outside the mainstream and still rejected by most Americans, are ascendant in the majority of state governments, the Supreme Court, and Congress. Meaningful environmental, labor, finance, and tax reforms have been stymied.Jane Mayer spent five years conducting hundreds of interviews-including with several sources within the network-and scoured public records, private papers, and court proceedings in reporting this book. In a taut and utterly convincing narrative, she traces the byzantine trail of the billions of dollars spent by the network and provides vivid portraits of the colorful figures behind the new American oligarchy.Dark Money is a book that must be read by anyone who cares about the future of American democracy.","['non-fiction', 'economics & politics', 'history', 'business & management']",1,2023-12-22 00:00:00

As the pressure to confess preposterous crimes increases, he relives a career that embodies the terrible ironies and human betrayals of a totalitarian movement masking itself as an instrument of deliverance. Almost unbearably vivid in its depiction of one man's solitary agony, it asks questions about ends and means that have relevance not only for the past but for the perilous present. It is â- as the Times Literary Supplement has declared â- ""A remarkable book, a grimly fascinating interpretation of the logic of the Russian Revolution, indeed of all revolutionary dictatorships, and at the same time a tense and subtly intellectualized drama.""","['fiction', 'history', 'economics & politics']",1,2020-10-24 00:00:00

Das Kapital,Karl Marx,/books/das-kapital,"One of the most notorious works of modern times, as well as one of the most influential, Capital is an incisive critique of private property and the social relations it generates. Living in exile in England, where this work was largely written, Marx drew on a wide-ranging knowledge of its society to support his analysis and generate fresh insights. Arguing that capitalism would create an ever-increasing division in wealth and welfare, he predicted its abolition and replacement by a system with common ownership of the means of production. Capital rapidly acquired readership among the leaders of social democratic parties, particularly in Russia and Germany, and ultimately throughout the world, to become a work described by Marx's friend and collaborator Friedrich Engels as 'the Bible of the Working Class'.","['non-fiction', 'philosophy', 'economics & politics', 'history']",1,2023-12-22 00:00:00

Days of Rage,Bryan Burrough,/books/days-of-rage,"From the bestselling author of Public Enemies and The Big Rich, an explosive account of the decade-long battle between the FBI and the homegrown revolutionary movements of the 1970s The Weathermen. The Symbionese Liberation Army. The FALN. The Black Liberation Army. The names seem quaint now, when not forgotten altogether. But there was a time in America, during the 1970s, when bombings by domestic underground groups were a daily occurrence. The FBI combated these and other groups as nodes in a single revolutionary underground, dedicated to the violent overthrow of the American government. In Days of Rage, Bryan Burrough re-creates an atmosphere that seems almost unbelievable just forty years later, conjuring a time of native-born radicals, most of them ânice middle-class kids,â smuggling bombs into skyscrapers and detonating them inside the Pentagon and the U.S. Capitol, at a Boston courthouse and a Wall Street restaurant packed with lunchtime diners. The FBIâs fevered response included the formation of a secret task force called Squad 47, dedicated to hunting the groups down and rolling them up. But Squad 47 itself broke many laws in its attempts to bring the revolutionaries to justice, and its efforts ultimately ended in fiasco. Drawing on revelatory interviews with members of the underground and the FBI who speak about their experiences for the first time, Days of Rage is a mesmerizing book that takes us into the hearts and minds of homegrown terrorists and federal agents alike and weaves their stories into a spellbinding secret history of the 1970s.","['non-fiction', 'economics & politics', 'history']",1,2023-12-22 00:00:00

Dealers of Lightning,Michael A. Hiltzik,/books/dealers-of-lightning,"Dealers of Lightning is the riveting story of the legendary Xerox PARC--a collection of eccentric young inventors brought together by Xerox Corporation at a facility in Palo Alto, California, during the mind-blowing intellectual ferment of the seventies and eighties. Here for the first time Michael Hiltzik, a correspondent for the Los Angeles Times, reveals in piercing detail the true story of the extraordinary group that aimed to bring about a technological dawn that would change the world--and succeeded.Based on extensive interviews with the scientists, engineers, administrators, and corporate executives who lived the story, Dealers of Lightning takes the read on a journey from PARC's beginnings in a dusty, abandoned building at the edge of the Stanford University campus to its triumph as a hothouse of ideas that spawned not only the first personal computer, but the windows-style graphical user interface, the laser printer, much of the indispensable technology of the Internet, and a great deal more. It shows how and why Xerox, despite its willingness to grant PARC unlimited funding and the responsibility for developing breakthroughs to keep the corporation on the cutting edge of office technology, remained forever unable to grasp (and, consequently, exploit) the innovations that PARC delivered--and it details the increasing frustration of the original PARC scientists, many of whom would go on to build their fortunes upon the very ideas Xerox so rashly discarded.More than just a riveting historical narrative, Dealers of Lightning brings to life an unforgettable cast of characters. Among them:Bob Taylor--the preacher's son from rural Texas who would be considered a prophet by some and a cantankerous egomaniac by others, whose fearless (and feared) leadership of a team of computer renegades made them the heroes of the embryonic Silicon Valley;Jack Goldman--the Xerox chief scientist who convinced the stolid corporation to stake tens of millions of dollars on PARC while warning that the investment might not pay off for years--if it paid off at all;Alan Kay--PARC's creative and philosophical soul, who suffered years of ridicule for envisioning a computer that could be tucked under the arm yet would contain the power to store books, symphonies, letters, poems, and drawings--until he arrived at Palo Alto and met the people who would build it; andSteve Jobs--who, aided by Xerox's indifference to PARC's most momentous inventions, staged a daring raid to obtain the technology that would end up at the heart of the Macintosh: the machine that for a time helped Apple dominate an explosive new market.Dealers of Lightning is an unprecedented look at the ideas, the inventions, and the individuals that propelled Xerox PARC to the frontier of technohistory--and the corporate machinations that almost prevented it from achieving greatness.","['non-fiction', 'business & management', 'technology', 'science & nature']",3,2023-12-22 00:00:00

Death of the Liberal Class,Chris Hedges,/books/death-of-the-liberal-class,"The liberal class plays a vital role in a democracy. It gives moral legitimacy to the state. It makes limited forms of dissent and incremental change possible. The liberal class posits itself as the conscience of the nation. It permits us, through its appeal to public virtues and the public good, to define ourselves as a good and noble people. Most importantly, on behalf of the power elite the liberal class serves as bulwarks against radical movements by offering a safety valve for popular frustrations and discontentment by discrediting those who talk of profound structural change. Once this class loses its social and political role then the delicate fabric of a democracy breaks down and the liberal class, along with the values it espouses, becomes an object of ridicule and hatred. The door that has been opened to proto-fascists has been opened by a bankrupt liberalism.The Death of the Liberal Class examines the failure of the liberal class to confront the rise of the corporate state and the consequences of a liberalism that has become profoundly bankrupted. Hedges argues there are five pillars of the liberal establishment â the press, liberal religious institutions, labor unions, universities and the Democratic Partyâ and that each of these institutions, more concerned with status and privilege than justice and progress, sold out the constituents they represented. In doing so, the liberal class has become irrelevant to society at large and ultimately the corporate power elite they once served.","['non-fiction', 'economics & politics', 'history']",1,2023-12-22 00:00:00

Debt,David Graeber,/books/debt,"Every economics textbook says the same thing: Money was invented to replace onerous and complicated barter systemsâto relieve ancient people from having to haul their goods to market. The problem with this version of history? Thereâs not a shred of evidence to support it.Here anthropologist David Graeber presents a stunning reversal of conventional wisdom: he shows that before there was money, there was debt. For more than 5,000 years, since the beginnings of the first agrarian empires, humans have used elaborate credit systems to buy and sell goodsâthat is, long before the invention of coins or cash. It is in this era, Graeber argues, that we also first encounter a society divided into debtors and creditors.Graeber shows that arguments about debt and debt forgiveness have been at the center of political debates from Italy to China, as well as sparking innumerable insurrections. He also brilliantly demonstrates that the language of the ancient works of law and religion (words like âguilt,â âsin,â and âredemptionâ) derive in large part from ancient debates about debt, and shape even our most basic ideas of right and wrong. We are still fighting these battles today without knowing it.Debt: The First 5,000 Years is a fascinating chronicle of this little known historyâas well as how it has defined human history, and what it means for the credit crisis of the present day and the future of our economy.","['non-fiction', 'economics & politics', 'money & investing']",3,2023-12-22 00:00:00

Deep Learning,Ian Goodfellow,/books/deep-learning,"An introduction to a broad range of topics in deep learning, covering mathematical and conceptual background, deep learning techniques used in industry, and research perspectives.Deep learning is a form of machine learning that enables computers to learn from experience and understand the world in terms of a hierarchy of concepts. Because the computer gathers knowledge from experience, there is no need for a human computer operator to formally specify all the knowledge that the computer needs. The hierarchy of concepts allows the computer to learn complicated concepts by building them out of simpler ones; a graph of these hierarchies would be many layers deep. This book introduces a broad range of topics in deep learning.The text offers mathematical and conceptual background, covering relevant concepts in linear algebra, probability theory and information theory, numerical computation, and machine learning. It describes deep learning techniques used by practitioners in industry, including deep feedforward networks, regularization, optimization algorithms, convolutional networks, sequence modeling, and practical methodology; and it surveys such applications as natural language processing, speech recognition, computer vision, online recommendation systems, bioinformatics, and videogames. Finally, the book offers research perspectives, covering such theoretical topics as linear factor models, autoencoders, representation learning, structured probabilistic models, Monte Carlo methods, the partition function, approximate inference, and deep generative models.âDeep Learning can be used by undergraduate or graduate students planning careers in either industry or research, and by software engineers who want to begin using deep learning in their products or platforms.

Deep Work,Cal Newport,/books/deep-work,"One of the most valuable skills in our economy is becoming increasingly rare. If you master this skill, you'll achieve extraordinary results.Deep work is the ability to focus without distraction on a cognitively demanding task. It's a skill that allows you to quickly master complicated information and produce better results in less time. Deep work will make you better at what you do and provide the sense of true fulfillment that comes from craftsmanship. In short, deep work is like a super power in our increasingly competitive twenty-first century economy. And yet, most people have lost the ability to go deep-spending their days instead in a frantic blur of e-mail and social media, not even realizing there's a better way.In DEEP WORK, author and professor Cal Newport flips the narrative on impact in a connected age. Instead of arguing distraction is bad, he instead celebrates the power of its opposite. Dividing this book into two parts, he first makes the case that in almost any profession, cultivating a deep work ethic will produce massive benefits. He then presents a rigorous training regimen, presented as a series of four ""rules,"" for transforming your mind and habits to support this skill.A mix of cultural criticism and actionable advice, DEEP WORK takes the reader on a journey through memorable stories -- from Carl Jung building a stone tower in the woods to focus his mind, to a social media pioneer buying a round-trip business class ticket to Tokyo to write a book free from distraction in the air -- and no-nonsense advice, such as the claim that most serious professionals should quit social media and that you should practice being bored.

Delicate Edible Birds,Lauren Groff,/books/delicate-edible-birds,"From Lauren Groff, author of the critically acclaimed and bestselling novel Fates and Furies, comes Delicate Edible Birds, one of the most striking short fiction debuts in years. Here are nine stories of astonishing insight and variety, each revealing a resonant drama within the life of a twentieth-century American woman.In ""Sir Fleeting,"" a Midwestern farm girl on her honeymoon in Argentina falls into lifelong lust for a French playboy. In ""Blythe,"" an attorney who has become a stay-at-home mother takes a night class in poetry and meets another full-time mother, one whose charismatic brilliance changes everything. In ""The Wife of the Dictator,"" that eponymous wife (""brought back . . . from [the dictator's] last visit to America"") grows more desperately, menacingly isolated every day. In ""Delicate Edible Birds,"" a group of war correspondents-a lone, high-spirited woman among them-falls sudden prey to a brutal farmer while fleeing Nazis in the French countryside. In ""Lucky Chow Fun,"" Groff returns us to Templeton, the setting of her first book, for revelations about the darkness within even that idyllic small town.In some of these stories, enormous changes happen in an instant. In others, transformations occur across a lifetime--or several lifetimes.Throughout the collection, Groff displays particular and vivid preoccupations. Crime is a motif--sex crimes, a possible murder, crimes of the heart. Love troubles recur; they're in every story--love in alcoholism, in adultery, in a flood, even in the great flu epidemic of 1918. Some of the love has depths, which are understood too late; some of the love is shallow, and also understood too late. And mastery is a theme--Groff's women swim and baton twirl, become poets, or try and try again to achieve the inner strength to exercise personal freedom.Overall, these stories announce a notable new literary master. Dazzlingly original and confident, Delicate Edible Birds further solidifies Groff's reputation as one of the foremost talents of her generation.",['fiction'],1,2020-09-24 00:00:00

Democracy Matters,Cornel West,/books/democracy-matters,"n his major bestseller, Race Matters, philosopher Cornel West burst onto the national scene with his searing analysis of the scars of racism in American democracy. Race Matters has become a contemporary classic, still in print after ten years, having sold more than four hundred thousand copies. A mesmerizing speaker with a host of fervidly devoted fans, West gives as many as one hundred public lectures a year and appears regularly on radio and television. Praised by The New York Times for his ""ferocious moral vision"" and hailed by Newsweek as ""an elegant prophet with attitude,"" he bridges the gap between black and white opinion about the country's problems.In Democracy Matters, West returns to the analysis of the arrested development of democracy-both in America and in the crisis-ridden Middle East. In a strikingly original diagnosis, he argues that if America is to become a better steward of democratization around the world, we must first wake up to the long history of imperialist corruption that has plagued our own democracy. Both our failure to foster peace in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and the crisis of Islamist anti-Americanism stem largely from hypocrisies in our dealings with the world. Racism and imperial expansionism have gone hand in hand in our country's inexorable drive toward hegemony, and our current militarism is only the latest expression of that drive. Even as we are shocked by Islamic fundamentalism, our own brand of fundamentalism, which West dubs Constantinian Christianity, has joined forces with imperialist corporate and political elites in an unholy alliance, and four decades after the murder of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., insidious racism still inflicts debilitating psychic pain on so many of our citizens.But there is a deep democratic tradition in America of impassioned commitment to the fight against imperialist corruptions-the last great expression of which was the civil rights movement led by Dr. King-and West brings forth the powerful voices of that great democratizing tradition in a brilliant and deeply moving call for the revival of our better democratic nature. His impassioned and provocative argument for the revitalization of America's democracy will reshape the terms of the raging national debate about America's role in today's troubled world.","['non-fiction', 'economics & politics', 'history']",1,2020-10-24 00:00:00

Democracy for Realists,Christopher Achen & Larry Bartels,/books/democracy-for-realists,"""Democracy for Realists"" assails the romantic folk-theory at the heart of contemporary thinking about democratic politics and government, and offers a provocative alternative view grounded in the actual human nature of democratic citizens.Christopher Achen and Larry Bartels deploy a wealth of social-scientific evidence, including ingenious original analyses of topics ranging from abortion politics and budget deficits to the Great Depression and shark attacks, to show that the familiar ideal of thoughtful citizens steering the ship of state from the voting booth is fundamentally misguided. They demonstrate that voters even those who are well informed and politically engaged mostly choose parties and candidates on the basis of social identities and partisan loyalties, not political issues. They also show that voters adjust their policy views and even their perceptions of basic matters of fact to match those loyalties. When parties are roughly evenly matched, elections often turn on irrelevant or misleading considerations such as economic spurts or downturns beyond the incumbents' control; the outcomes are essentially random. Thus, voters do not control the course of public policy, even indirectly.Achen and Bartels argue that democratic theory needs to be founded on identity groups and political parties, not on the preferences of individual voters.

Deng Xiaoping,Alexander V. Pantsov,/books/deng-xiaoping,"Deng Xiaoping joined the Chinese Communist Party as a young man and ascended through the ranks to become Mao's most senior lieutenant in the 1930s. Deng became the de facto leader of the Chinese Communist Party and the architect of China's post-Mao reforms two years after Mao's death in 1976. He put in motion measures that would significantly overhaul China's economy, society, and status in the world, abandoning the Maoist socio-economic policies he had long espoused. We are still living with the consequences three decades later. China has risen to become the world's second biggest economy and the world's workshop. Despite the fact that it is fundamentally a market economy (""socialism with Chinese characteristics""), Deng and his successors guaranteed the CCP's leadership by suppressing democratic movements and keeping an iron grip on power.Deng, who died in 1997 at the age of 92, had set China on the path it is still on today. Deng Xiaoping's new biography by Alexander Pantsov and Steven Levine offers what no previous biography has done: it covers his whole life, from his youth and school years through the post-Tiananmen era, using newly unearthed materials. The writers give a lot of fresh evidence on Deng dating back to the 1920s, thanks to unparalleled access to Russian archives having enormous files on the Chinese Communist Party. Deng handled one enormous catastrophe after another during his long and exceptional life. Deng, who was born in 1904, spent part of the 1920s in Paris, where he joined the CCP in its early years, as did many other Asian revolutionary leaders. He went on to study in the Soviet Union at a time when Stalin was consolidating his grip on the Soviet communist party. During the turbulent 1930s and 1940s, which were defined by civil war and the Japanese invasion, he played an increasingly crucial role.","['non-fiction', 'history', 'biographies & memoirs', 'economics & politics']",1,2022-01-24 00:00:00
Deng Xiaoping and the Transformation of China,Ezra F. Vogel,/books/deng-xiaoping-and-the-transformation-of-china,"A Gates Notes Top Read of the Year.Perhaps no one in the twentieth century had a greater long-term impact on world history than Deng Xiaoping. And no scholar of contemporary East Asian history and culture is better qualified than Ezra Vogel to disentangle the many contradictions embodied in the life and legacy of Chinaâs boldest strategist.Once described by Mao Zedong as a âneedle inside a ball of cotton,â Deng was the pragmatic yet disciplined driving force behind Chinaâs radical transformation in the late twentieth century. He confronted the damage wrought by the Cultural Revolution, dissolved Maoâs cult of personality, and loosened the economic and social policies that had stunted Chinaâs growth. Obsessed with modernization and technology, Deng opened trade relations with the West, which lifted hundreds of millions of his countrymen out of poverty. Yet at the same time he answered to his authoritarian roots, most notably when he ordered the crackdown in June 1989 at Tiananmen Square.Dengâs youthful commitment to the Communist Party was cemented in Paris in the early 1920s, among a group of Chinese student-workers that also included Zhou Enlai. Deng returned home in 1927 to join the Chinese Revolution on the ground floor. In the fifty years of his tumultuous rise to power, he endured accusations, purges, and even exile before becoming Chinaâs preeminent leader from 1978 to 1989 and again in 1992. When he reached the top, Deng saw an opportunity to creatively destroy much of the economic system he had helped build for five decades as a loyal follower of Maoâand he did not hesitate.","['non-fiction', 'biographies & memoirs', 'economics & politics', 'history']",1,2023-12-22 00:00:00

Desert Solitaire,Edward Abbey,/books/desert-solitaire,"Hailed by The New York Times as âa passionately felt, deeply poetic book,â the moving autobiographical work of Edward Abbey, considered the Thoreau of the American West, and his passion for the southwestern wilderness.Desert Solitaire is a collection of vignettes about life in the wilderness and the nature of the desert itself by park ranger and conservationist, Edward Abbey. The book details the unique adventures and conflicts the author faces, from dealing with the damage caused by development of the land or excessive tourism, to discovering a dead body. However Desert Solitaire is not just a collection of one manâs stories, the book is also a philosophical memoir, full of Abbeyâs reflections on the desert as a paradox, at once beautiful and liberating, but also isolating and cruel. Often compared to Thoreauâs Walden, Desert Solitaire is a powerful discussion of lifeâs mysteries set against the stirring backdrop of the American southwestern wilderness.","['non-fiction', 'science & nature']",1,2023-12-22 00:00:00

Destined for War,Graham Allison,/books/destined-for-war,"CHINA AND THE UNITED STATES ARE HEADING TOWARD A WAR NEITHER WANTS. The reason is Thucydidesâs Trap, a deadly pattern of structural stress that results when a rising power challenges a ruling one. This phenomenon is as old as history itself. About the Peloponnesian War that devastated ancient Greece, the historian Thucydides explained: âIt was the rise of Athens and the fear that this instilled in Sparta that made war inevitable.â Over the past 500 years, these conditions have occurred sixteen times. War broke out in twelve of them. Today, as an unstoppable China approaches an immovable America and both Xi Jinping and Donald Trump promise to make their countries âgreat again,â the seventeenth case looks grim. Unless China is willing to scale back its ambitions or Washington can accept becoming number two in the Pacific, a trade conflict, cyberattack, or accident at sea could soon escalate into all-out war.In Destined for War, the eminent Harvard scholar Graham Allison explains why Thucydidesâs Trap is the best lens for understanding U.S.-China relations in the twenty-first century. Through uncanny historical parallels and war scenarios, he shows how close we are to the unthinkable. Yet, stressing that war is not inevitable, Allison also reveals how clashing powers have kept the peace in the past â and what painful steps the United States and China must take to avoid disaster today.","['non-fiction', 'history', 'economics & politics']",3,2023-12-22 00:00:00

Devil in the Grove,Gilbert King,/books/devil-in-the-grove,"Devil in the Grove is the winner of the 2013 Pulitzer Prize for General Nonfiction.Arguably the most important American lawyer of the twentieth century, Thurgood Marshall was on the verge of bringing the landmark suit Brown v. Board of Education before the U.S. Supreme Court when he became embroiled in an explosive and deadly case that threatened to change the course of the civil rights movement and cost him his life.In 1949, Floridaâs orange industry was booming, and citrus barons got rich on the backs of cheap Jim Crow labor. To maintain order and profits, they turned to Willis V. McCall, a violent sheriff who ruled Lake County with murderous resolve. When a white seventeen-year-old Groveland girl cried rape, McCall was fast on the trail of four young blacks who dared to envision a future for themselves beyond the citrus groves. By dayâs end, the Ku Klux Klan had rolled into town, burning the homes of blacks to the ground and chasing hundreds into the swamps, hell-bent on lynching the young men who came to be known as âthe Groveland Boys.âAnd so began the chain of events that would bring Thurgood Marshall, the man known as âMr. Civil Rights,â into the deadly fray. Associates thought it was suicidal for him to wade into the âFlorida Terrorâ at a time when he was irreplaceable to the burgeoning civil rights movement, but the lawyer would not shrink from the fightânot after the Klan had murdered one of Marshallâs NAACP associates involved with the case and Marshall had endured continual threats that he would be next.Drawing on a wealth of never-before-published material, including the FBIâs unredacted Groveland case files, as well as unprecedented access to the NAACPâs Legal Defense Fund files, King shines new light on this remarkable civil rights crusader, setting his rich and driving narrative against the heroic backdrop of a case that U.S. Supreme Court justice Robert Jackson decried as âone of the best examples of one of the worst menaces to American justice.â","['non-fiction', 'history', 'biographies & memoirs']",2,2023-12-22 00:00:00
Devil's Bargain,Joshua Green,/books/devils-bargain,"The instant #1 New York Times bestseller.From the reporter who was there at the very beginning comes the revealing inside story of the partnership between Steve Bannon and Donald Trumpâthe key to understanding the rise of the alt-right, the fall of Hillary Clinton, and the hidden forces that drove the greatest upset in American political history.Based on dozens of interviews conducted over six years, Green spins the master narrative of the 2016 campaign from its origins in the far fringes of right-wing politics and reality television to its culmination inside Trumpâs penthouse on election night.The shocking elevation of Bannon to head Trumpâs flagging presidential campaign on August 17, 2016, hit political Washington like a thunderclap and seemed to signal the meltdown of the Republican Party. Bannon was a bomb-throwing pugilist whoâd never run a campaign and was despised by Democrats and Republicans alike. Yet Bannonâs hard-edged ethno-nationalism and his elaborate, years-long plot to destroy Hillary Clinton paved the way for Trumpâs unlikely victory. Trump became the avatar of a dark but powerful worldview that dominated the airwaves and spoke to voters whom others couldnât see. Trumpâs campaign was the final phase of a populist insurgency that had been building up in America for years, and Bannon, its inscrutable mastermind, believed it was the culmination of a hard-right global uprising that would change the world.Any study of Trumpâs rise to the presidency is unavoidably a study of Bannon. Devilâs Bargain is a tour-de-force telling of the remarkable confluence of circumstances that decided the election, many of them orchestrated by Bannon and his allies, who really did plot a vast, right-wing conspiracy to stop Clinton. To understand Trump's extraordinary rise and Clintonâs fall, you have to weave Trumpâs story together with Bannonâs, or else it doesn't make sense.","['non-fiction', 'economics & politics', 'biographies & memoirs']",1,2023-12-22 00:00:00

Different,Youngme Moon,/books/different,"Why trying to be the best â¦ competing like crazy â¦ makes you mediocre.Every few years a bookâthrough a combination of the authorâs unique voice, storytelling ability, wit, and insightâsimply breaks the mold. Bill Brysonâs A Walk in the Woods is one example. Richard Feynmanâs âSurely Youâre Joking, Mr. Feynman!â is another.Now comes Youngme Moonâs Different, a book for âpeople who donât read business books.â Actually, itâs more like a personal conversation with a friend who has thought deeply about how the world works â¦ and who gets you to see that world in a completely new light.If there is one strain of conventional wisdom pervading every company in every industry, itâs the absolute importance of âcompeting like crazy.â Youngme Moonâs message is simply âGet off this treadmill thatâs taking you nowhere. Going tit for tat and adding features, augmentations, and gimmicks to beat the competition has the perverse result of making you like everyone else.â Different provides a highly original perspective on what it means to offer something that is meaningfully differentâdifferent in a manner that is both fundamental and comprehensive.Youngme Moon identifies the outliers, the mavericks, the iconoclastsâthe players who have thoughtfully rejected orthodoxy in favor of an approach that is more adventurous. Some are even âhostile,â almost daring you to buy what they are selling. The MINI Cooper was launched with fearless abandon: âWorried that this car is too small? Look here. Itâs even smaller than you think.âThese are players that strike a genuine chord with even the most jaded consumers. In fact, almost every success story of the past two decades has been an exception to the rule. Simply go to your computer and compare AOL and Yahoo! with Google. The former pile on feature upon feature to their home pages, while Google is like an austere boutique, dominating a category filled with âextras.ââDifferent shows how to succeed in a world where conformity reignsâ¦but exceptions rule.","['non-fiction', 'business & management', 'self improvement']",2,2023-12-22 00:00:00
Differential Forms in Algebraic Topology,Raoul Bott,/books/differential-forms-in-algebraic-topology,"Developed from a first-year graduate course in algebraic topology, this text is an informal introduction to some of the main ideas of contemporary homotopy and cohomology theory. The materials are structured around four core areas: de Rham theory, the Cech-de Rham complex, spectral sequences, and characteristic classes. By using the de Rham theory of differential forms as a prototype of cohomology, the machineries of algebraic topology are made easier to assimilate. With its stress on concreteness, motivation, and readability, this book is equally suitable for self-study and as a one-semester course in topology.","['non-fiction', 'science & nature']",1,2023-12-22 00:00:00
Differential Topology,Victor W. Guillemin & Alan Pollack,/books/differential-topology,"Differential Topology provides an elementary and intuitive introduction to the study of smooth manifolds. In the years since its first publication, Guillemin and Pollack's book has become a standard text on the subject. It is a jewel of mathematical exposition, judiciously picking exactly the right mixture of detail and generality to display the richness within. The text is mostly self-contained, requiring only undergraduate analysis and linear algebra. By relying on a unifying idea--transversality--the authors are able to avoid the use of big machinery or ad hoc techniques to establish the main results. In this way, they present intelligent treatments of important theorems, such as the Lefschetz fixed-point theorem, the PoincarÃ¸Â-Hopf index theorem, and Stokes theorem. The book has a wealth of exercises of various types. Some are routine explorations of the main material.","['non-fiction', 'science & nature']",1,2023-12-22 00:00:00

Digital Minimalism,Cal Newport,/books/digital-minimalism,"Minimalism is the art of knowing how much is just enough. Digital minimalism applies this idea to our personal technology. It's the key to living a focused life in an increasingly noisy world.In this timely and enlightening book, the bestselling author of Deep Work introduces a philosophy for technology use that has already improved countless lives.Digital minimalists are all around us. They're the calm, happy people who can hold long conversations without furtive glances at their phones. They can get lost in a good book, a woodworking project, or a leisurely morning run. They can have fun with friends and family without the obsessive urge to document the experience. They stay informed about the news of the day, but don't feel overwhelmed by it. They don't experience ""fear of missing out"" because they already know which activities provide them meaning and satisfaction.Now, Newport gives us a name for this quiet movement, and makes a persuasive case for its urgency in our tech-saturated world. Common sense tips, like turning off notifications, or occasional rituals like observing a digital sabbath, don't go far enough in helping us take back control of our technological lives, and attempts to unplug completely are complicated by the demands of family, friends and work. What we need instead is a thoughtful method to decide what tools to use, for what purposes, and under what conditions.Drawing on a diverse array of real-life examples, from Amish farmers to harried parents to Silicon Valley programmers, Newport identifies the common practices of digital minimalists and the ideas that underpin them. He shows how digital minimalists are rethinking their relationship to social media, rediscovering the pleasures of the offline world, and reconnecting with their inner selves through regular periods of solitude. He then shares strategies for integrating these practices into your life, starting with a thirty-day ""digital declutter"" process that has already helped thousands feel less overwhelmed and more in control.Technology is intrinsically neither good nor bad. The key is using it to support your goals and values, rather than letting it use you. This book shows the way.","['non-fiction', 'self improvement', 'psychology', 'technology', 'philosophy']",10,2023-12-22 00:00:00

Even when they work long days. Even when their kids' schedules pull them in eighteen different directions. They are not superhuman. They are not from another planet.With simple strategies and common sense, Jenny figured out how to break down dinnerâthe food, the timing, the anxiety, from prep to cleanupâso that her family could enjoy good food, time to unwind, and simply be together.Using the same straight-up, inspiring voice that readers of her award-winning blog, Dinner: A Love Story, have come to count on, Jenny never judges and never preaches.

Dinosaur Training Secrets: Volume I,Brooks D. Kubik,/books/dinosaur-training-secrets-volume-i,"In the early 1990's I began writing for Stuart McRobert's Hardgainer magazine. In 1996, I published Dinosaur Training: Lost Secrets of Strength and Development. Since then, I've written and published more than 20 books and courses and written thousands of blog posts and articles on strength training, muscle building, weightlifting and Iron Game history, famous strongmen and how they trained, diet, nutrition, and the all-important mental aspects of strength training. I've edited and published close to 100 issues of The Dinosaur Files newsletter, which is now available in a journal-sized quarterly format, and I've put together over a dozen strength training DVD's. I've done close to 100 podcast interviews, delivered audio seminars, presented live seminars, and answered thousands of training questions from readers around the word. By conservative estimate, I've written well over one million words about strength training, muscle building and physical culture.I've done thisâand I continue to do itâbecause I've made it my life's work to promote sane, sensible, result producing and effective strength training and muscle buildingâand to teach and preserve the very best traditions of old-school physical culture. My goal is to teach as many people as possible about the kind of training that really worksâthe kind of training that builds real-world strength, muscle and power, promotes life-long good health and develops the mind and the heart of a true champion.This book is the first in a series of books that will collect, collate and update all of the information in my other books, courses and articles. We're going to begin with a very important topic: the most effective exercises, and how to put them together into workouts and training programs that will build strength, muscle and power as rapidly and efficiently as possible. There is a wealth of valuable information in this book, and if you read, study and apply what you find within its pages, I have no doubt that you will enjoy great gains and rapid progress. I also believe that although your training will require plenty of hard work, you'll find your workouts to be fun and enjoyable.

Dirt,David R. Montgomery,/books/dirt,"We are surrounded by dirt, soil, or whatever you choose to name it. It is the source of our existence, providing support for our feet, crops, and cities. However, we are running out of soil, and it's not a funny issue, according to this intriguing yet disturbing book. Dirt: The Erosion of Civilizations is an engrossing natural and cultural history of soil that spans ancient civilizations to present times, exploring the compelling premise that humans are â and have long been â depleting Earth's soil. Once stripped of their protecting flora and exposed to the elements, cultivated soils progressively degrade, slow enough to be overlooked in a single lifetime but quick enough to shorten civilizations' lifespans across generations.Dirt recounts the role of soil usage and abuse in the history of Mesopotamia, Ancient Greece, the Roman Empire, China, European colonisation, Central America, and the American march westward, using a rich combination of history, archaeology, and geology. As civilization after society has grown, thrived, and ploughed through a natural endowment of rich earth, we can observe how soil has formed us and how we have shaped soil. David R. Montgomery finds promise for a new agricultural revolution in the recent emergence of organic and no-till farming, which he believes can help humanity escape the destiny of earlier civilizations","['non-fiction', 'science & nature']",1,2023-12-22 00:00:00
Dirt and Disease,Naomi Rogers,/books/dirt-and-disease,"""Will have an enthusiastic audience among historians of medicine who are familiar, for the most part, only with later twentieth-century efforts to combat polio."" --Allan M. Brandt, University of North CarolinaDirt and Disease is a social, cultural, and medical history of the polio epidemic in the United States. Naomi Rogers focuses on the early years from 1900 to 1920, and continues the story to the present. She explores how scientists, physicians, patients, and their families explained the appearance and spread of polio and how they tried to cope with it. Rogers frames this study of polio within a set of larger questions about health and disease in twentieth-century American culture.In the early decades of this century, scientists sought to understand the nature of polio. They found that it was caused by a virus, and that it could often be diagnosed by analyzing spinal fluid. Although scientific information about polio was understood and accepted, it was not always definitive. This knowledge coexisted with traditional notions about disease and medicine.Polio struck wealthy and middle-class children as well as the poor. But experts and public health officials nonetheless blamed polio on a filthy urban environment, bad hygiene, and poverty. This allowed them to hold slum-dwelling immigrants responsible, and to believe that sanitary education and quarantines could lessen the spread of the disease. Even when experts acknowledged that polio struck the middle-class and native-born as well as immigrants, they tried to explain this away by blaming the fly for the spread of polio. Flies could land indiscriminately on the rich and the poor.In the 1930s, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt helped to recast the image of polio and to remove its stigma. No one could ignore the cross-spread of the disease. By the 1950s, the public was looking to science for prevention and therapy. But Rogers reminds us that the recent history of polio was more than the history of successful vaccines. She points to competing therapies, research tangents, and people who died from early vaccine trials.",['non-fiction'],1,2023-12-22 00:00:00
Dirty Plotte,Julie Doucet,/books/dirty-plotte,"An enduring collection of revolutionary comics from a genre-transforming and critically acclaimed cartoonistJulie Doucet arrived in comics in the 1990s as a fully formed cartoonist.

Her stories are candid, funny and intimate, plumbing the depths of the female psyche while charting the fragility of the men around her. Her artwork is dense and confident, never wavering in the wit and humour of its owner. Doucet was active in comics for fifteen years before she moved on to other mediums.

Echoes of the disappearance reverberate across a tightly woven community, with the fear and loss felt most deeply among its women.Set on the remote Siberian peninsula of Kamchatka, Disappearing Earth draws us into the world of an astonishing cast of characters, all connected by an unfathomable crime. We are transported to vistas of rugged beauty â densely wooded forests, open expanses of tundra, soaring volcanoes and the glassy seas that border Japan and Alaska â and into a region as complex as it is alluring, where social and ethnic tensions have long simmered, and where outsiders are often the first to be accused.In a story as propulsive as it is emotionally engaging, and through a young writer's virtuosic feat of empathy and imagination, this powerful novel provides a new understanding of the intricate bonds of family and community, in a Russia unlike any we have seen before.",['fiction'],1,2020-10-24 00:00:00

Discipline Is Destiny,Ryan Holiday,/books/discipline-is-destiny,"To master anything, one must first master themselvesâoneâs emotions, oneâs thoughts, oneâs actions. Eisenhower famously said that freedom is really the opportunity to practice self-discipline. Cicero called the virtue of temperance the polish of life. Without boundaries and restraint, we risk not only failing to meet our full potential and jeopardizing what we have achieved, but we ensure misery and shame. In a world of temptation and excess, this ancient idea is more urgent than ever.In Discipline is Destiny, Holiday draws on the stories of historical figures we can emulate as pillars of self-discipline, including Lou Gehrig, Queen Elizabeth II, boxer Floyd Patterson, Marcus Aurelius and writer Toni Morrison, as well as the cautionary tales of Napoleon, F. Scott Fitzgerald and Babe Ruth. Through these engaging examples, Holiday teaches readers the power of self-discipline and balance, and cautions against the perils of extravagance and hedonism.At the heart of Stoicism are four simple virtues: courage, temperance, justice, and wisdom. Everything else, the Stoics believed, flows from them. Discipline is Destiny will guide readers down the path to self-mastery, upon which all the other virtues depend. Discipline is predictive. You cannot succeed without it. And if you lose it, you cannot help but bring yourself failure and unhappiness.","['non-fiction', 'philosophy', 'self improvement']",0,2023-11-21 00:00:00

But whatever I heard him say, the same I attempted to write down in his own words as nearly as possible, for the purpose of preserving them as memorials to myself afterwards of the thoughts and the freedom of speech of Epictetus.

Discover Your Inner Economist,Tyler Cowen,/books/discover-your-inner-economist,"Read Tyler Cowen's posts on the Penguin Blog.In Discover Your Inner Economist one of Americaâs most respected economists presents a quirky, incisive romp through everyday life that reveals how you can turn economic reasoning to your advantageâoften when you least expect it to be relevant.Like no other economist, Tyler Cowen shows how economic notions--such as incentives, signals, and markets--apply far more widely than merely to the decisions of social planners, governments, and big business. What does economic theory say about ordering from a menu? Or attracting the right mate? Or controlling people who talk too much in meetings? Or dealing with your dentist? With a wryly amusing voice, in chapters such as âHow to Control the World, The Basicsâ and âHow to Control the World, Knowing When to Stopâ Cowen reveals the hidden economic patterns behind everyday situations so you can get more of what you really want.Readers will also gain less selfish insights into how to be a good partner, neighbor and even citizen of the world. For instance, what is the best way to give to charity? The chapter title âHow to Save the WorldâMore Christmas Presents Wonât Helpâ makes a point that is every bit as personal as it is global.Incentives are at the core of an economic approach to the world, but they donât just come in cash. In fact, money can be a disincentive. Cowen shows why, for example, it doesnât work to pay your kids to do the dishes. Other kinds of incentives--like making sure family members know they will be admired if they respect you--can work. Another non- monetary incentive? Try having everyone stand up in your next meeting if you donât want anyone to drone on. Deeply felt incentives like pride in oneâs work or a passing smile from a loved one, can be the most powerful of all, even while they operate alongside more mundane rewards such as money and free food.Discover Your Inner Economist is an introduction to the science of economics that shows it to be built on notions that are already within all of us. While the implications of those ideas lead to Cowenâs often counterintuitive advice, their wisdom is presented in ordinary examples taken from home life, work life, and even vacation lifeâ¦ How do you get a good guide in a Moroccan bazaar?","['non-fiction', 'economics & politics', 'business & management', 'self improvement']",1,2023-12-22 00:00:00

DisneyWar,James B. Stewart,/books/disneywar,"The dramatic inside story of the downfall of Michael EisnerâDisney Chairman and CEOâand the scandals that drove Americaâs best-known entertainment company to civil war.âWhen You Wish Upon a Star,â âWhistle While You Work,â âThe Happiest Place on Earthââthese are lyrics indelibly linked to Disney, one of the most admired and best-known companies in the world. So when Roy Disney, chairman of Walt Disney Animation and nephew of founder Walt Disney, abruptly resigned in November 2003 and declared war on chairman and chief executive Michael Eisner, he sent shock waves through the entertainment industry, corporate boardrooms, theme parks, and living rooms around the worldâeverywhere Disney does business and its products are cherished.Drawing on unprecedented access to both Eisner and Roy Disney, current and former Disney executives and board members, as well as thousands of pages of never-before-seen letters, memos, transcripts, and other documents, James B. Stewart gets to the bottom of mysteries that have enveloped Disney for years: What really caused the rupture with studio chairman Jeffrey Katzenberg, a man who once regarded Eisner as a father but who became his fiercest rival? How could Eisner have so misjudged Michael Ovitz, a man who was not only âthe most powerful man in Hollywoodâ but also his friend, whom he appointed as Disney president and immediately wanted to fire? What caused the break between Eisner and Pixar chairman Steve Jobs, and why did Pixar abruptly abandon its partnership with Disney? Why did Eisner so mistrust Roy Disney that he assigned Disney company executives to spy on him? How did Eisner control the Disney board for so long, and what really happened in the fateful board meeting in September 2004, when Eisner played his last cards?DisneyWar is an enthralling tale of one of Americaâs most powerful media and entertainment companies, the people who control it, and those trying to overthrow them. It tells a story thatâin its sudden twists, vivid, larger-than-life characters, and thrilling climaxâmight itself have been the subject of a Disney classicâexcept that itâs all true.","['non-fiction', 'business & management', 'biographies & memoirs']",1,2023-12-22 00:00:00

Disrupted,Dan Lyons,/books/disrupted,"For twenty-five years Dan Lyons was a magazine writer at the top of his profession--until one Friday morning when he received a phone call: Poof. His job no longer existed. ""I think they just want to hire younger people,"" his boss at Newsweek told him. Fifty years old and with a wife and two young kids, Dan was, in a word, screwed. Then an idea hit. Dan had long reported on Silicon Valley and the tech explosion. Why not join it? HubSpot, a Boston start-up, was flush with $100 million in venture capital. They offered Dan a pile of stock options for the vague role of ""marketing fellow."" What could go wrong?HubSpotters were true believers: They were making the world a better place ... by selling email spam. The office vibe was frat house meets cult compound: The party began at four thirty on Friday and lasted well into the night; ""shower pods"" became hook-up dens; a push-up club met at noon in the lobby, while nearby, in the ""content factory,"" Nerf gun fights raged. Groups went on ""walking meetings,"" and Dan's absentee boss sent cryptic emails about employees who had ""graduated"" (read: been fired). In the middle of all this was Dan, exactly twice the age of the average HubSpot employee, and literally old enough to be the father of most of his co-workers, sitting at his desk on his bouncy-ball ""chair.""Mixed in with Lyons's uproarious tale of his rise and fall at Hubspot is a trenchant analysis of the start-up world, a de facto conspiracy between those who start companies and those who fund them, a world where bad ideas are rewarded with hefty investments, where companies blow money lavishing perks on their post-collegiate workforces, and where everybody is trying to hang on just long enough to reach an IPO and cash out.With a cast of characters that includes devilish angel investors, fad-chasing venture capitalists, entrepreneurs and ""wantrapreneurs,"" bloggers and brogrammers, social climbers and sociopaths, Disrupted is a gripping and definitive account of life in the (second) tech bubble.","['non-fiction', 'business & management', 'biographies & memoirs', 'technology']",3,2023-12-22 00:00:00

Divergent Mind,Jenara Nerenberg,/books/divergent-mind,"As a successful Harvard and Berkeley-educated writer, entrepreneur, and devoted mother, Jenara Nerenberg was shocked to discover that her âsymptomsâ--only ever labeled as anxiety-- were considered autistic and ADHD. Being a journalist, she dove into the research and uncovered neurodiversityâa framework that moves away from pathologizing âabnormalâ versus ânormalâ brains and instead recognizes the vast diversity of our mental makeups. When it comes to women, sensory processing differences are often overlooked, masked, or mistaken for something else entirely. Between a flawed system that focuses on diagnosing younger, male populations, and the fact that girls are conditioned from a young age to blend in and conform to gender expectations, women often donât learn about their neurological differences until they are adults, if at all. As a result, potentially millions live with undiagnosed or misdiagnosed neurodivergences, and the misidentification leads to depression, anxiety, low self-esteem, and shame. Meanwhile, we all miss out on the gifts their neurodivergent minds have to offer.Divergent Mind is a long-overdue, much-needed answer for women who have a deep sense that they are âdifferent.â Sharing real stories from women with high sensitivity, ADHD, autism, misophonia, dyslexia, SPD and more, Nerenberg explores how these brain variances present differently in women and dispels widely-held misconceptions (for example, itâs not that autistic people lack sensitivity and empathy, they have an overwhelming excess of it).Nerenberg also offers us a path forward, describing practical changes in how we communicate, how we design our surroundings, and how we can better support divergent minds. When we allow our wide variety of brain makeups to flourish, we create a better tomorrow for us all.","['non-fiction', 'self improvement']",0,2023-11-21 00:00:00

As opposed to focusing on ""fitting it all in,"" time management, and leaning in, as so many books geared at ambitious women do, this book embraces the notion that through doing less women can have--and be--more.The addiction to busyness and the obsession with always trying to do more leads women, especially working mothers, to feel like they're always failing their families, their careers, their spouses, and themselves. This book will give women the permission and tools to change the way they approach their lives and allow them to embrace living in tune with the cyclical nature of the feminine, cutting out the extraneous busyness from their lives so they have more satisfaction and joy, and letting themselves be more often instead of doing all the time.âDo Less offers the reader a series of 14 experiments to try to see what would happen if she did less in one specific way.

Emotions play a powerful role in shaping our financial behavior, often making us our own worst enemies as we try to save, access value, and spend responsibly. In Dollars and Sense, bestselling author and behavioral economist Dan Ariely teams up with financial comedian and writer Jeff Kreisler to challenge many of our most basic assumptions about the precarious relationship between our brains and our money.

Together Ariely and Kreisler reveal the emotional forces working against us and how we can counteract them. Mixing case studies and anecdotes with concrete advice and lessons, they cut through the unconscious fears and desires driving our worst financial instincts and teach us how to improve our money habits.The result not only reveals the rationale behind our most head-scratching financial choices but also offers clear guidance for navigating the treacherous financial landscape of the brain.

Don't Get Too Comfortable,David Rakoff,/books/dont-get-too-comfortable,"A bitingly funny grand tour of our culture of excess from an award-winning humorist.Whether David Rakoff's contrasting the elegance of one of the last flights of the supersonic Concorde with the good-times-and-chicken-wings populism of Hooters Air; working as a cabana boy at a South Beach hotel; or traveling to a private island off the coast of Belize to watch a soft-core video shoot where he is provided with his very own personal manservant rarely have greed, vanity, selfishness, and vapidity been so mercilessly skewered. Somewhere along the line, our healthy self-regard has exploded into obliterating narcissism; our manic getting and spending have now become celebrated as moral virtues. Simultaneously a Wildean satire and a plea for a little human decency, Don t Get Too Comfortable shows that far from being bobos in paradise, we are in a special circle of gilded-age hell.","['non-fiction', 'arts & entertainment', 'biographies & memoirs']",1,2020-10-24 00:00:00

"Donât Sleep, There Are Snakes",Daniel Everett,/books/dont-sleep-there-are-snakes,"A riveting account of the astonishing experiences and discoveries made by linguist Daniel Everett while he lived with the PirahÃ£, a small tribe of Amazonian Indians in central Brazil.Everett, then a Christian missionary, arrived among the PirahÃ£ in 1977âwith his wife and three young childrenâintending to convert them. What he found was a language that defies all existing linguistic theories and reflects a way of life that evades contemporary understanding: The PirahÃ£ have no counting system and no fixed terms for color. They have no concept of war or of personal property. They live entirely in the present. Everett became obsessed with their language and its cultural and linguistic implications, and with the remarkable contentment with which they liveâso much so that he eventually lost his faith in the God heâd hoped to introduce to them.Over three decades, Everett spent a total of seven years among the PirahÃ£, and his account of this lasting sojourn is an engrossing exploration of language that questions modern linguistic theory. It is also an anthropological investigation, an adventure story, and a riveting memoir of a life profoundly affected by exposure to a different culture. Written with extraordinary acuity, sensitivity, and openness, it is fascinating from first to last, rich with unparalleled insight into the nature of language, thought, and life itself.","['non-fiction', 'biographies & memoirs']",1,2020-10-24 00:00:00

Doughnut Economics,Kate Raworth,/books/doughnut-economics,"Economics is broken. It has failed to predict, let alone prevent, financial crises that have shaken the foundations of our societies. Its outdated theories have permitted a world in which extreme poverty persists while the wealth of the super-rich grows year on year. And its blind spots have led to policies that are degrading the living world on a scale that threatens all of our futures.Can it be fixed? In Doughnut Economics, Oxford academic Kate Raworth identifies seven critical ways in which mainstream economics has led us astray, and sets out a roadmap for bringing humanity into a sweet spot that meets the needs of all within the means of the planet. En route, she deconstructs the character of ârational economic manâ and explains what really makes us tick. She reveals how an obsession with equilibrium has left economists helpless when facing the boom and bust of the real-world economy. She highlights the dangers of ignoring the role of energy and natureâs resources â and the far-reaching implications for economic growth when we take them into account. And in the process, she creates a new, cutting-edge economic model that is fit for the 21st century â one in which a doughnut-shaped compass points the way to human progress.Ambitious, radical and rigorously argued, Doughnut Economics promises to reframe and redraw the future of economics for a new generation.","['non-fiction', 'economics & politics', 'business & management']",1,2023-12-22 00:00:00

Dreamland,Sam Quinones,/books/dreamland,"In fascinating detail, Sam Quinones chronicles how, over the past 15 years, enterprising sugar cane farmers in a small county on the west coast of Mexico created a unique distribution system that brought black tar heroinâthe cheapest, most addictive form of the opiate, 2 to 3 times purer than its white powder cousinâto the veins of people across the United States. Communities where heroin had never been seen beforeâfrom Charlotte, NC and Huntington, WVA, to Salt Lake City and Portland, ORâwere overrun with it. Local police and residents were stunned. How could heroin, long considered a drug found only in the dense, urban environments along the East Coast, and trafficked into the United States by enormous Colombian drug cartels, be so incredibly ubiquitous in the American heartland? Who was bringing it here, and perhaps more importantly, why were so many townspeople suddenly eager for the comparatively cheap high it offered?With the same dramatic drive of El Narco and Methland, Sam Quinones weaves together two classic tales of American capitalism: The stories of young men in Mexico, independent of the drug cartels, in search of their own American Dream via the fast and enormous profits of trafficking cheap black-tar heroin to Americaâs rural and suburban addicts; and that of Purdue Pharma in Stamford, Connecticut, determined to corner the market on pain with its new and expensive miracle drug, Oxycontin; extremely addictive in its own right. Quinones illuminates just how these two stories fit together as cause and effect: hooked on costly Oxycontin, American addicts were lured to much cheaper black tar heroin and its powerful and dangerous long-lasting high. Embroiled alongside the suppliers and buyers are DEA agents, local, small-town sheriffs, and the US attorney from eastern Virginia whose case against Purdue Pharma and Oxycontin made him an enemy of the Bush-era Justice Department, ultimately stalling and destroying his career in public service.âDreamland is a scathing and incendiary account of drug culture and addiction spreading to every part of the American landscape.","['non-fiction', 'history', 'economics & politics']",2,2023-12-22 00:00:00

Like so many driven and talented women who have been brought up to believe that to have it all, they must do it all, Dufu began to feel that achieving her career and personal goals was an impossibility. Eventually, she discovered the solution: letting go. In Drop the Ball, Dufu recounts how she learned to reevaluate expectations, shrink her to-do list, and meaningfully engage the assistance of others--freeing the space she needed to flourish at work and to develop deeper, more meaningful relationships at home.Even though women are half the workforce, they still represent only eighteen per cent of the highest level leaders. The reasons are obvious: just as women reach middle management they are also starting families. Mounting responsibilities at work and home leave them with no bandwidth to do what will most lead to their success. Offering new perspective on why the women's leadership movement has stalled, and packed with actionable advice, Tiffany Dufu's Drop the Ball urges women to embrace imperfection, to expect less of themselves and more from others--only then can they focus on what they truly care about, devote the necessary energy to achieving their real goals, and create the type of rich, rewarding life we all desire.","['non-fiction', 'business & management', 'self improvement', 'biographies & memoirs']",2,2023-12-22 00:00:00
Dropping Ashes on the Buddha,Seung Sahn,/books/dropping-ashes-on-the-buddha,"âSomebody comes into the Zen center with a lighted cigarette, walks up to the Buddha statue, blows smoke in its face, and drops ashes on its lap. You are standing there. What can you do?â This is a problem that Zen Master Seung Sahn is fond of posing to his American students who attend his Zen centers. Dropping Ashes on the Buddha is a delightful, irreverent, and often hilariously funny living record of the dialogue between Korean Zen Master Seung Sahn and his American students. Consisting of dialogues, stories, formal Zen interviews, Dharma speeches, and letters using the Zen Masterâs actual words in spontaneous, living interaction with his students, this book is a fresh presentation of the Zen teaching method of âinstant dialogueâ between Master and student which, through the use of astonishment and paradox, leads to an understanding of ultimate reality.","['non-fiction', 'spirituality & religion', 'philosophy']",1,2023-12-22 00:00:00

Drunk Tank Pink,Adam Alter,/books/drunk-tank-pink,"A revelatory look at how our environment unconsciously yet dramatically shapes the judgments and decisions we make every day.Most of us go through life believing that we are in control of the choices we make, that we think and behave almost independently from the world around us, but as Drunk Tank Pink illustrates, the truth is our environment shapes our thoughts and actions in myriad ways without our permission or even our knowledge. Armed with surprising data and endlessly fascinating examples, Adam Alter addresses the subtle but substantial ways in which outside forces influence us--such as colorâs influence on mood, our bias in favor of names with which we identify, and how sunny days can induce optimism as well as aggression. Drunk Tank Pink proves that the truth behind our feelings and actions goes much deeper than the choices we take for granted every day.","['non-fiction', 'psychology', 'science & nature']",2,2023-12-22 00:00:00

Duty,Robert Gates,/books/duty,"From the former secretary of defense, a strikingly candid, vividly written account of his experience serving Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama during the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.Before Robert M. Gates received a call from the White House in 2006, he thought heâd left Washington politics behind: after working for six presidents in both the CIA and the National Security Council, he was happy in his role as president of Texas A&M University. But when he was asked to help a nation mired in two wars and to aid the troops doing the fighting, he answered what he felt was the call of duty. Now, in this unsparing memoir, meticulously fair in its assessments, he takes us behind the scenes of his nearly five years as a secretary at war: the battles with Congress, the two presidents he served, the military itself, and the vast Pentagon bureaucracy; his efforts to help Bush turn the tide in Iraq; his role as a guiding, and often dissenting, voice for Obama; the ardent devotion to and love for American soldiersâhis âheroesââhe developed on the job.In relating his personal journey as secretary, Gates draws us into the innermost sanctums of government and military power during the height of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, illuminating iconic figures, vital negotiations, and critical situations in revealing, intimate detail. Offering unvarnished appraisals of Dick Cheney, Joe Biden, Hillary Clinton, and Presidents Bush and Obama among other key players, Gates exposes the full spectrum of behind-closed-doors politicking within both the Bush and Obama administrations.He discusses the great controversies of his tenureâsurges in both Iraq and Afghanistan, Â how to deal with Iran and Syria, âDonât Ask Donât Tell,â GuantÃ¡namo Bay, WikiLeaksâas they played out behind the television cameras. He brings to life the Situation Room during the Bin Laden raid. And, searingly, he shows how congressional debate and action or inaction on everything from equipment budgeting to troop withdrawals was often motivated, to his increasing despair and anger, more by party politics and media impact than by membersâ desires to protect our soldiers and ensure their success.However embroiled he became in the trials of Washington, Gates makes clear that his heart was always in the most important theater of his tenure as secretary: the front lines. We journey with him to both war zones as he meets with active-duty troops and their commanders, awed by their courage, and also witness him greet coffin after flag-draped coffin returned to U.S. soil, heartbreakingly aware that he signed every deployment order. In frank and poignant vignettes, Gates conveys the human cost of war, and his admiration for those brave enough to undertake it when necessary.âDuty tells a powerful and deeply personal story that allows us an unprecedented look at two administrations and the wars that have defined them.","['non-fiction', 'biographies & memoirs', 'history', 'economics & politics']",1,2020-10-24 00:00:00

Dying for a Paycheck,Jeffrey Pfeffe,/books/dying-for-a-paycheck,"In one survey, 61 percent of employees said that workplace stress had made them sick and 7 percent said they had actually been hospitalized. Job stress costs US employers more than $300 billion annually and may cause 120,000 excess deaths each year. In China, 1 million people a year may be dying from overwork. Â People are literally dying for a paycheck. And it needs to stop.In this timely, provocative book, Jeffrey Pfeffer contends that many modern management commonalities such as long work hours, work-family conflict, and economic insecurity are toxic to employeesâhurting engagement, increasing turnover, and destroying peopleâs physical and emotional healthâand also inimical to company performance. Â He argues that human sustainability should be as important as environmental stewardship.You donât have to do a physically dangerous job to confront a health-destroying, possibly life-threatening, workplace. Just ask the manager in a senior finance role whose immense workload, once handled by several employees, required frequent all-nightersâleading to alcohol and drug addiction. Or the dedicated news media producer whose commitment to getting the story resulted in a sixty-pound weight gain thanks to having no down time to eat properly or exercise. Or the marketing professional prescribed antidepressants a week after joining her employer.In Dying for a Paycheck, Jeffrey Pfeffer marshals a vast trove of evidence and numerous examples from all over the world to expose the infuriating truth about modern work life: even as organizations allow management practices that literally sicken and kill their employees, those policies do not enhance productivity or the bottom line, thereby creating a lose-lose situation.Exploring a range of important topics including layoffs, health insurance, work-family conflict, work hours, job autonomy, and why people remain in toxic environments, Pfeffer offers guidance and practical solutions all of usâemployees, employers, and the governmentâcan use to enhance workplace wellbeing. We must wake up to the dangers and enormous costs of todayâs workplace, Pfeffer argues. Dying for a Paycheck is a clarion call for a social movement focused on human sustainability. Pfeffer makes clear that the environment we work in is just as important as the one we live in, and with this urgent book, he opens our eyes and shows how we can make our workplaces healthier and better.","['non-fiction', 'business & management', 'economics & politics']",1,2020-10-24 00:00:00

Earth Abides,George R. Stewart,/books/earth-abides,"The cabin had always been a special retreat for Isherwood Williams, a haven from the demands of society. But one day while hiking, Ish was bitten by a rattlesnake, and the solitude he had so desired took on dire new significance.He was sick for days â although, somehow, he never doubted that he'd live through the ordeal. Often delirious, he did awake at one point to find two strangers peering in at him from the cabin door. Yet oddly, instead of offering help, the two ran off as if terrified.Not long after that, the coughing began.

Earth in Human Hands,David Grinspoon,/books/earth-in-human-hands,"For the first time in Earth's history, a convergence of fast accelerating events is being triggered by a single species: humans. Climate change is only the most evident of the changes we've caused to the world unknowingly up to now. And our current actions jeopardies not just our own but also the futures of countless other animals. Astrobiologist David Grinspoon compares Earth's story to those of other worlds, demonstrating what a bizarre and original development it is for a species to evolve to construct technology, and eventually, global societies with world-shaping impact.Grinspoon says that, while the difficulties of the coming century are daunting, the current moment is nevertheless full with opportunity, especially when considered from a 10,000-year perspective. Our species has survived extinction before, because to our natural inventiveness and adaptability, and there's reason to believe we may do so again.Our duty now is to become aware of our position as a force for planetary change and to mature into it. We must evolve into elegant planetary engineers, cognizant shapers of our surroundings, and stewards of the ecosystem. This is a viewpoint that forces us to consider not just what future we want to avoid, but also what future we want to construct. What sort of world do we want to live in? Is humanity the worst or finest thing that has ever happened to our planet?

Eat Pray Love,Elizabeth Gilbert,/books/eat-pray-love,"A celebrated writer's irresistible, candid, and eloquent account of her pursuit of worldly pleasure, spiritual devotion, and what she really wanted out of life.Around the time Elizabeth Gilbert turned thirty, she went through an early-onslaught midlife crisis. She had everything an educated, ambitious American woman was supposed to wantâa husband, a house, a successful career. But instead of feeling happy and fulfilled, she was consumed with panic, grief, and confusion. She went through a divorce, a crushing depression, another failed love, and the eradication of everything she ever thought she was supposed to be.To recover from all this, Gilbert took a radical step. In order to give herself the time and space to find out who she really was and what she really wanted, she got rid of her belongings, quit her job, and undertook a yearlong journey around the worldâall alone. Eat, Pray, Love is the absorbing chronicle of that year. Her aim was to visit three places where she could examine one aspect of her own nature set against the backdrop of a culture that has traditionally done that one thing very well. In Rome, she studied the art of pleasure, learning to speak Italian and gaining the twenty-three happiest pounds of her life. India was for the art of devotion, and with the help of a native guru and a surprisingly wise cowboy from Texas, she embarked on four uninterrupted months of spiritual exploration. In Bali, she studied the art of balance between worldly enjoyment and divine transcendence. She became the pupil of an elderly medicine man and also fell in love the best wayâunexpectedly.An intensely articulate and moving memoir of self-discovery, Eat, Pray, Love is about what can happen when you claim responsibility for your own contentment and stop trying to live in imitation of societyâs ideals.

Eclipse: A Song Called Youth: Book One,John Shirley,/books/eclipse-a-song-called-youth-book-one,"This gripping cyberpunk novel â the first in a trilogy â envisions a future in which the economy of the United States has crashed, while the Soviet Union not only remains intact but invades Western Europe. With the collapse of NATO, governments have abdicated control to an ostensibly private antiterrorist and security firm, the Second Alliance. But the fascist mercenaries of the alliance are working from a hidden agenda, and their only challenge comes from the New Resistance, a rogues' gallery of rebels who battle mind control and weapons of mass destruction with sex and drugs and rock 'n' roll.The ""eclipse"" of the title refers to the shadows that war casts across the light of conventional morality, allowing citizens to tolerate the erosion of their civil rights. The plot, praised as ""chillingly plausible and carefully developed"" by Kirkus Reviews, shifts between the political chaos of Earth and the vast space colony of FirStep. Originally published in 1985, the novel offers prescient views of the rise of drone surveillance, the growth of Europe's radical right movements, and an increasingly dark web of media manipulation and propaganda. A compelling tale in its own right, Eclipse offers a wealth of action and intrigue that reaches a thrilling climax and conclusion in the sequels Eclipse Penumbra and Eclipse Corona.

Economics in One Lesson,Henry Hazlitt,/books/economics-in-one-lesson,"With over a million copies sold, Economics in One Lesson is an essential guide to the basics of economic theory. A fundamental influence on modern libertarianism, Hazlitt defends capitalism and the free market from economic myths that persist to this day.Considered among the leading economic thinkers of the âAustrian School,â which includes Carl Menger, Ludwig von Mises, Friedrich (F.A.) Hayek, and others, Henry Hazlitt (1894-1993), was a libertarian philosopher, an economist, and a journalist. He was the founding vice-president of the Foundation for Economic Education and an early editor of The Freeman magazine, an influential libertarian publication.  Hazlitt wrote Economics in One Lesson, his seminal work, in 1946. Concise and instructive, it is also deceptively prescient and far-reaching in its efforts to dissemble economic fallacies that are so prevalent they have almost become a new orthodoxy.Economic commentators across the political spectrum have credited Hazlitt with foreseeing the collapse of the global economy which occurred more than 50 years after the initial publication of Economics in One Lesson. Hazlittâs focus on non-governmental solutions, strong â and strongly reasoned â anti-deficit position, and general emphasis on free markets, economic liberty of individuals, and the dangers of government intervention make Economics in One Lesson every bit as relevant and valuable today as it has been since publication.","['non-fiction', 'economics & politics', 'business & management', 'money & investing']",6,2023-12-22 00:00:00

Educated,Tara Westover,/books/educated,"An unforgettable memoir about a young girl who, kept out of school, leaves her survivalist family and goes on to earn a PhD from Cambridge UniversityBorn to survivalists in the mountains of Idaho, Tara Westover was seventeen the first time she set foot in a classroom. Her family was so isolated from mainstream society that there was no one to ensure the children received an education, and no one to intervene when one of Taraâs older brothers became violent. When another brother got himself into college, Tara decided to try a new kind of life. Her quest for knowledge transformed her, taking her over oceans and across continents, to Harvard and to Cambridge University. Only then would she wonder if sheâd traveled too far, if there was still a way home.âBeautiful and propulsive . . . Despite the singularity of [Tara Westoverâs] childhood, the questions her book poses are universal: How much of ourselves should we give to those we love? And how much must we betray them to grow up?ââVogueâWestover has somehow managed not only to capture her unsurpassably exceptional upbringing, but to make her current situation seem not so exceptional at all, and resonant for many others.ââThe New York Times Book Review","['biographies & memoirs', 'non-fiction']",7,2023-12-22 00:00:00

Ego Is the Enemy,Ryan Holiday,/books/ego-is-the-enemy,"The instant Wall Street Journal, USA Today, and international bestsellerâWhile the history books are filled with tales of obsessive visionary geniuses who remade the world in their image with sheer, almost irrational force, Iâve found that history is also made by individuals who fought their egos at every turn, who eschewed the spotlight, and who put their higher goals above their desire for recognition.â âfrom the prologueMany of us insist the main impediment to a full, successful life is the outside world. In fact, the most common enemy lies within: our ego. Early in our careers, it impedes learning and the cultivation of talent. With success, it can blind us to our faults and sow future problems. In failure, it magnifies each blow and makes recovery more difficult. At every stage, ego holds us back.Ego Is the Enemy draws on a vast array of stories and examples, from literature to philosophy to hisÂ­tory. We meet fascinating figures such as George Marshall, Jackie Robinson, Katharine Graham, Bill Belichick, and Eleanor Roosevelt, who all reached the highest levels of power and success by conÂ­quering their own egos. Their strategies and tactics can be ours as well.In an era that glorifies social media, reality TV, and other forms of shameless self-promotion, the battle against ego must be fought on many fronts. Armed with the lessons in this book, as Holiday writes, âyou will be less invested in the story you tell about your own specialness, and as a result, you will be liberated to accomplish the world-changing work youâve set out to achieve.â","['non-fiction', 'business & management', 'philosophy', 'self improvement', 'psychology']",8,2023-12-22 00:00:00

Einstein,Walter Isaacson,/books/einstein,"By the author of the acclaimed bestsellers Benjamin Franklin and Steve Jobs, this is the definitive biography of Albert Einstein.How did his mind work? What made him a genius? Isaacsonâs biography shows how his scientific imagination sprang from the rebellious nature of his personality. His fascinating story is a testament to the connection between creativity and freedom.Based on newly released personal letters of Einstein, this book explores how an imaginative, impertinent patent clerkâa struggling father in a difficult marriage who couldnât get a teaching job or a doctorateâbecame the mind reader of the creator of the cosmos, the locksmith of the mysteries of the atom, and the universe. His success came from questioning conventional wisdom and marveling at mysteries that struck others as mundane. This led him to embrace a morality and politics based on respect for free minds, free spirits, and free individuals.These traits are just as vital for this new century of globalization, in which our success will depend on our creativity, as they were for the beginning of the last century, when Einstein helped usher in the modern age.","['biographies & memoirs', 'non-fiction', 'science & nature', 'history']",10,2023-12-22 00:00:00
